Installation instructions for Slay V1.1 Smaug port
--------------------------------------------------

1. To install the main function in the file slay.c, you can use one of
   2 methods:

   A. Cut/Paste the code into act_wiz.c somewhere as is.
   B. Copy slay.c into your code directory, then add slay.o and slay.c
	to the appropriate locations in your Makefile.

2. Add the following define below MAX_HERB in mud.h:

   #define MAX_SLAY_TYPES		9

3. Add the following code in mud.h near the other structures:
   
struct slay_type
{
  char *        owner;		/* only this player can use this option */
  char *        title;		/* each one must have a unique title!   */
  int  	    color;        /* color to send with messages */
  char *        char_msg;	/* is sent to the "slayer"		*/
  char *        vict_msg;	/* is sent to the "slayee" (poor sucker)*/
  char *        room_msg;	/* is sent to everyone else in the room */
};

4. Find the do_slay function in fight.c and comment it out.

5. Make clean, and then recompile.

This should complete the installation process. If I've missed anything
or you have problems incorporating it into your code, feel free to email
me at samson@aviastar.net with the subject: SLAY CODE

This snippet has been tested on both a stock 1.02a distribution as well
as one running Matthew's color code snippet, so everything should come
out quite nicely.

To configure new slay options, follow the examples in the code, or refer
to slay.hlp for instructions. Be sure and raise MAX_SLAY_TYPES by the
number of new slays you add :)

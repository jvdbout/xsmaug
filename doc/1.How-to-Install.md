How to Install XSMAUG
=====

**XSMAUG** is easier to install than other MUDs, but every site is different.

### 1) Download XSMAUG

```
	https://github.com/smaugmuds/xsmaug/releases
```

### 2) Build XSMAUG

Now, you can build XSMAUG like any other GNU Software:

```
	cd xsmaug
	sh autogen.sh
	./configure --prefix=/opt/xsmaug --with-gnu-ld
	make
	make install
```

This will take up 5 to 10 minutes, depending on the speed of your hardware.

When finished you can add "/opt/xsmaug" to your environment "$PATH":

```
	export PATH=$PATH:/opt/xsmaug/bin
```

### 3) Start the XSMAUG MUD Realm

```	
	xsmaug-server
```

### 4) Enter de game:

```
	telnet localhost 4000
```
	
### 5) Create an Immortal Character

To make your first immortal character, just start as a mortal character, play at least as far as level 2, and then edit the player file and change your level.  (After the first immortal, you can advance the rest).

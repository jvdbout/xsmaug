Terms of Use
------------

1. You may use this snippet in your code provided that any included
comment headers in the code are left intact. You may add your own, but
do not take mine out.

2. This snippet may not be posted for redistribution on any site
without obtaining prior written consent from the Alsherok team.

3. ( optional ) Register with the forums at http://forums.alsherok.net
Registration is not required to make use of the snippet, but since I no
longer provide email support for any of the code I release, forum posts
are your only avenue for direct support. This may seem overly stupid,
but you can blame the continuing abuse I suffer from spammers for this.
Don't post stuff to TMC or TMS asking about my code. I'm highly unlikely
to ever notice it there on the rare ocassions I skim posts in either place.

If forum registration doesn't appeal to you, then you can try to get ahold
of me via IMC on the code channel.

If you can't agree to these terms, don't use this code, and don't expect
me to help if something breaks while installing it. Harsh? Hardly. I'm
tired of people who come crawling to whine and complain when they haven't
bothered to comply with the terms first.

What this code does
-------------------

This gives you a simple command that will allow players to send a short
sound tone to each other to get their attention. The ability to beep
another person can be regulated via the use of PCFLAG_NOBEEP which is
a toggle added to the do_config command.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1. In act_comm.c, add the following code:

/* Beep command courtesy of Altrag */
/* Installed by Samson on unknown date, allows user to beep other users */
void do_beep( CHAR_DATA *ch, char *argument )
{
   CHAR_DATA *victim;

   if( ch->pcdata->release_date != 0 )
   {
      send_to_char( "Nope, no beeping from hell.\r\n", ch );
      return;
   }

   if( !argument || !( victim = get_char_world( ch, argument ) ) )
   {
      send_to_char( "Beep who?\r\n", ch );
      return;
   }

   /* NPC check added by Samson 2-15-98 */
   if( IS_NPC( victim ) || is_ignoring( victim, ch ) )
   {
      send_to_char( "Beep who?\r\n", ch );
      return;
   }

   /* PCFLAG_NOBEEP check added by Samson 2-15-98 */
   if( IS_SET( victim->pcdata->flags, PCFLAG_NOBEEP ) )
   {
      ch_printf( ch, "%s is not accepting beeps at this time.\r\n", victim->name );
      return;
   }

   ch_printf( victim, "%s is beeping you!\a\r\n", PERS( ch, victim, TRUE ) );
   ch_printf( ch, "You beep %s.\r\n", PERS( victim, ch, TRUE ) );
   return;
}

2. In mud.h, find the PCFLAGS section and add the following in an
   empty bitvector slot, where xx is the next available number:

   #define PCFLAG_NOBEEP		   BVxx   /* Added by Samson 2-15-98 */

   Add the following in the appropriate section:

   DECLARE_DO_FUN( do_beep );

3. In act_info.c, find the following in do_config:

   IS_SET( ch->pcdata->flags, PCFLAG_NOSUMMON ) 	? "[+] NOSUMMON"
                                                     	: "[-] nosummon"

   and below it add:

   IS_SET( ch->pcdata->flags, PCFLAG_NOBEEP   )  	? "[+] NOBEEP"
							: "[-] nobeep"

4. Also in act_info.c, do_config, find the following:

          else if ( !str_prefix( arg+1, "pager"    ) ) bit = PCFLAG_PAGERON;

    and below it add:

	    else if ( !str_prefix( arg+1, "nobeep" ) ) bit = PCFLAG_NOBEEP;

5. Make the appropriate entries for do_beep in tables.c.

6. Make clean, then recompile.

7. Create a beep command, setting it to the desired level.

8. Add the included help text to help.are (see below).

Suggested helpfile entry:

2 BEEP~
Syntax: beep <player>
 
BEEP sends a short sound blip to the other user's terminal to get their
attention. If someone doesn't respond right away, please don't keep
spamming them with beeps. Try back again later, they may have gone afk.

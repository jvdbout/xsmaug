Server IP Binding
-----------------

General tip - should be useable on nearly all merc derived codebases.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1. In comm.c, function init_socket, locate the following code:

    memset(&sa, '\0', sizeof(sa));
    sa.sin_family   = AF_INET;
    sa.sin_port	    = htons( port );

    Add this line right below it:

    /* sa.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr( "x.x.x.x" ); */

2. Recompile, your done :)

As stated, this additional line of code should work on nearly any
MERC or ROM derived codebase. There should be no need to use it
unless the server you happen to be on specifically requires you to
bind your MUD to its own IP address, in which case they'll give you
the proper number to substitute for x.x.x.x. Don't forget to uncomment
the line if you need it :P

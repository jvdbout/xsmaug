Auth system Cset patch

Terms of Use
------------

1. You may use this snippet in your code provided that any included
comment headers in the code are left intact. You may add your own, but
do not take mine out.

2. This snippet may not be posted for redistribution on any site
without obtaining prior written consent from the Alsherok team.

3. ( optional ) Register with the forums at http://forums.alsherok.net
Registration is not required to make use of the snippet, but since I no
longer provide email support for any of the code I release, forum posts
are your only avenue for direct support. This may seem overly stupid,
but you can blame the continuing abuse I suffer from spammers for this.
Don't post stuff to TMC or TMS asking about my code. I'm highly unlikely
to ever notice it there on the rare ocassions I skim posts in either place.

If forum registration doesn't appeal to you, then you can try to get ahold
of me via IMC on the code channel.

If you can't agree to these terms, don't use this code, and don't expect
me to help if something breaks while installing it. Harsh? Hardly. I'm
tired of people who come crawling to whine and complain when they haven't
bothered to comply with the terms first.

What this code does
-------------------

This is a fairly simple, yet useful snippet. It adds an option to the cset
control panel to turn the name authorization system on or off without having
to reboot the mud. This can be used independently of any of the various
auth systems out there since it is only concerend with turning it on or off.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1. In act_wiz.c, locate function do_cset, and find the following code:

    pager_printf_color(ch, "\r\n&WMail:\r\n  &wRead all mail: &W%d  &wRead mail for free: &W%d  &wWrite mail for free: &W%d\r\n",
	    sysdata.read_all_mail, sysdata.read_mail_free, sysdata.write_mail_free );
    pager_printf_color(ch, "  &wTake all mail: &W%d", sysdata.take_others_mail );

  Immediately below that, add this line:

   pager_printf_color(ch, "\r\n&wName authorization: &W%s\r\n", sysdata.WAIT_FOR_AUTH ? "On" : "Off" );
       
  Further down in the function, locate the following code:

  argument = one_argument( argument, arg );
  smash_tilde( argument );

  if (!str_cmp(arg, "help"))
  {
     do_help(ch, "controls");
     return;
  }

  And right below it, add this code:

   if( !str_cmp( arg, "auth" ) )
   {
      sysdata.WAIT_FOR_AUTH = !sysdata.WAIT_FOR_AUTH;

      if( sysdata.WAIT_FOR_AUTH )
         send_to_char( "Name authorization system enabled.\r\n", ch );
      else
         send_to_char( "Name authorization system disabled.\r\n", ch );
      return;
   }

2. Make clean, recompile.

There should be no need for any other modifications to other files since
the WAIT_FOR_AUTH variable is already a part of the sysdata structure.

Prerequisite Requirements
-------------------------

Successful install of Overland ANSI Maps.
Successful install of Cronel's Renumber Command.

Terms of Use
------------

1. You may use this snippet in your code provided that any included
comment headers in the code are left intact. You may add your own, but
do not take mine out.

2. This snippet may not be posted for redistribution on any site
without obtaining prior written consent from the Alsherok team.

3. ( optional ) Register with the forums at http://forums.alsherok.net
Registration is not required to make use of the snippet, but since I no
longer provide email support for any of the code I release, forum posts
are your only avenue for direct support. This may seem overly stupid,
but you can blame the continuing abuse I suffer from spammers for this.
Don't post stuff to TMC or TMS asking about my code. I'm highly unlikely
to ever notice it there on the rare ocassions I skim posts in either place.

If forum registration doesn't appeal to you, then you can try to get ahold
of me via IMC on the code channel.

If you can't agree to these terms, don't use this code, and don't expect
me to help if something breaks while installing it. Harsh? Hardly. I'm
tired of people who come crawling to whine and complain when they haven't
bothered to comply with the terms first.

What this code does
-------------------

When renumbering an area that has incoming exits from the overland,
the renumber command will now find the new vnum and change the exit
accordingly. It does not need to change the outgoing exits from zones
to the overland since the vnum of the exit room is irrelevent.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1. Locate the translate_exits function in renumber.c, and replace
   it with the following:

void translate_exits( CHAR_DATA *ch, AREA_DATA *area, RENUMBER_AREA *r_area, bool verbose )
{
	int i, new_vnum;
	EXIT_DATA *exit, *rev_exit;
	ROOM_INDEX_DATA *room;
	int old_vnum;

	for( i=area->low_r_vnum ; i<=area->hi_r_vnum ; i++ )
	{
		room = get_room_index( i );
		if( !room )
			continue;
		for( exit = room->first_exit ; exit ; exit = exit->next )
		{
			/* translate the exit destination, if it was moved */
			new_vnum = find_translation( exit->vnum, r_area->r_room );
			if( new_vnum != NOT_FOUND )
				exit->vnum = new_vnum;
			/* if this room was moved */
			if( exit->rvnum != i )
			{
				old_vnum = exit->rvnum;
				exit->rvnum = i;
				/* all reverse exits in other areas will be wrong */
				rev_exit = get_exit_to( exit->to_room, rev_dir[exit->vdir], old_vnum );
				if( rev_exit && exit->to_room->area != area )
				{
					if( rev_exit->vnum != i )
					{
						pager_printf(ch, "...    fixing reverse exit in area %s.\r\n", 
							exit->to_room->area->filename );
						rev_exit->vnum = i;
					}
				}
			}

			/* translate the key */
			if( exit->key != -1 )
			{
				new_vnum = find_translation( exit->key, r_area->r_obj );
				if( new_vnum == NOT_FOUND )
					continue;
				exit->key = new_vnum;
			}
		}
		/* Find any exits from the overland to this area and change the target vnums accordingly - Samson */
		for( enter = first_entrance; enter; enter = enter->next )
		{
		   new_vnum = find_translation( enter->vnum, r_area->r_room );
		   if( new_vnum != NOT_FOUND )
		   {
			enter->vnum = new_vnum;
			send_to_pager( "...    fixing overland exit to area.\r\n", ch );
		   }
		}
	}
}

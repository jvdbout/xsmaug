Terms of Use

1. You may use this snippet in your code provided that any included
comment headers in the code are left intact. You may add your own, but
do not take mine out.

2. This snippet may not be posted for redistribution on any site
without obtaining prior written consent from the Alsherok team.

3. ( optional ) Register with the forums at http://forums.alsherok.net
Registration is not required to make use of the snippet, but since I no
longer provide email support for any of the code I release, forum posts
are your only avenue for direct support. This may seem overly stupid,
but you can blame the continuing abuse I suffer from spammers for this.
Don't post stuff to TMC or TMS asking about my code. I'm highly unlikely
to ever notice it there on the rare ocassions I skim posts in either place.

If forum registration doesn't appeal to you, then you can try to get ahold
of me via IMC on the code channel.

If you can't agree to these terms, don't use this code, and don't expect
me to help if something breaks while installing it. Harsh? Hardly. I'm
tired of people who come crawling to whine and complain when they haven't
bothered to comply with the terms first.

What this code does
-------------------

This is a really useful little utility for builders and other imms to check
areas for all the standard entry and exit points it has, including teleport
rooms. It will not count up exits by mudprograms though.

Here's an example of its output:

To: Overland  237X  161Y From:             deme.are Room  3700 (north)
To: Overland  237X  169Y From:             deme.are Room  3701 (south)
To: hdcaverns.are        Room: 29241 From: deme.are             Room  3703 (down)
From: hdcaverns.are        Room: 29241 To: deme.are             Room  3703 (up)
From: Overland  237X  162Y To: Room  3700
From: Overland  237X  168Y To: Room  3701

The program will default to the area you are standing in if you fail to
specify an argument to it. Otherwise it accepts the filename for any
area listed on the 'zones' command output.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1. In build.c, or any other file you feel is appropriate, 
   add the following code:

/* Shogar's code to hunt for exits/entrances to/from a zone, very nice */
/* Display improvements and overland support by Samson of Alsherok */
void do_aexit( CHAR_DATA * ch, char *argument )
{
   ROOM_INDEX_DATA *room;
   int i, vnum, lrange, trange;
   AREA_DATA *tarea, *otherarea;
   EXIT_DATA *pexit;
   bool found = FALSE;
#ifdef OVERLANDCODE
   ENTRANCE_DATA *enter;
#endif

   if( argument[0] == '\0' )
      tarea = ch->in_room->area;
   else
   {
      for( tarea = first_area; tarea; tarea = tarea->next )
         if( !str_cmp( tarea->filename, argument ) )
         {
            found = TRUE;
            break;
         }

#endif
   return;
}

2. Add the appropriate declaration in mud.h for do_aexit

3. Add the appropriate entries in tables.c for do_aexit

4. Make clean, recompile

Terms of Use
------------

1. You may use this snippet in your code provided that any included
comment headers in the code are left intact. You may add your own, but
do not take mine out.

2. This snippet may not be posted for redistribution on any site
without obtaining prior written consent from the Alsherok team.

3. ( optional ) Register with the forums at http://forums.alsherok.net
Registration is not required to make use of the snippet, but since I no
longer provide email support for any of the code I release, forum posts
are your only avenue for direct support. This may seem overly stupid,
but you can blame the continuing abuse I suffer from spammers for this.
Don't post stuff to TMC or TMS asking about my code. I'm highly unlikely
to ever notice it there on the rare ocassions I skim posts in either place.

If forum registration doesn't appeal to you, then you can try to get ahold
of me via IMC on the code channel.

If you can't agree to these terms, don't use this code, and don't expect
me to help if something breaks while installing it. Harsh? Hardly. I'm
tired of people who come crawling to whine and complain when they haven't
bothered to comply with the terms first.

What this code does
-------------------

Allows your players to destroy an item in their possession.
Brutally simple :)

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1. Somewhere in act_obj.c, add the following code:

/* Junk command installed by Samson 1-13-98
 * Code courtesy of Stu, from the mailing list. Allows player to destroy an item in their inventory.
 * Debugged and cleaned up on 4-16-01 by Samson.
 */
void do_junk( CHAR_DATA * ch, char *argument )
{
   OBJ_DATA *obj, *obj_next;
   bool found = FALSE;

   if( !argument || argument[0] == '\0' )
   {
      send_to_char( "Junk what?\r\n", ch );
      return;
   }

   for( obj = ch->first_carrying; obj; obj = obj_next )
   {
      obj_next = obj->next_content;
      if( ( nifty_is_name( argument, obj->name ) ) && can_see_obj( ch, obj ) && obj->wear_loc == WEAR_NONE )
      {
         found = TRUE;
         break;
      }
   }
   if( found )
   {
      if( !can_drop_obj( ch, obj ) && ch->level < LEVEL_IMMORTAL )
      {
         send_to_char( "You cannot junk that, it's cursed!\r\n", ch );
         return;
      }
      separate_obj( obj );
      obj_from_char( obj );
      extract_obj( obj );
      act( AT_ACTION, "$n junks $p.", ch, obj, NULL, TO_ROOM );
      act( AT_ACTION, "You junk $p.", ch, obj, NULL, TO_CHAR );
   }
   return;
}

2. In mud.h and tables.c, make the appropriate additions for do_junk.

3. Make clean, then recompile.

4. Create a junk command.

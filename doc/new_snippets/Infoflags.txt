do not take mine out.

2. This snippet may not be posted for redistribution on any site

Registration is not required to make use of the snippet, but since I no
longer provide email support for any of the code I release, forum posts
are your only avenue for direct support. This may seem overly stupid,
but you can blame the continuing abuse I suffer from spammers for this.
Don't post stuff to TMC or TMS asking about my code. I'm highly unlikely
to ever notice it there on the rare ocassions I skim posts in either place.

If forum registration doesn't appeal to you, then you can try to get ahold
of me via IMC on the code channel.

If you can't agree to these terms, don't use this code, and don't expect
me to help if something breaks while installing it. Harsh? Hardly. I'm
tired of people who come crawling to whine and complain when they haven't
bothered to comply with the terms first.

What this code does
-------------------

This is one of my early bits of code that I was going to release initally back in
1997, but for whatever reason, I never got around to doing that. Basically all
this does is display information about an area to an immortal in it. Useful
when building to see what has been set on the room without having to keep
checking rstat. Here's an example of the output:

[Area Flags: noastral noportal norecall nosummon noscry noteleport]
[Room Flags: indoors]
[Sector Type: indoors]
[Area name: Halls of the Gods]  [Area filename: gods.are]

The exact output of the flags will vary depending on your mud, but you get the idea :)

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1. Open act_info.c, and locate the following code in do_look:

	/* 'look' or 'look auto' */
	set_char_color( AT_RMNAME, ch );
	send_to_char( ch->in_room->name, ch );
	send_to_char( "\r\n", ch );

   Directly below that, add the following code:

	/* Room flag display installed by Samson 12-10-97 */
	if( !IS_NPC(ch) && IS_IMMORTAL(ch) && IS_SET( ch->pcdata->flags, PCFLAG_AUTOFLAGS ) )
	{
	   set_char_color( AT_IMMORTAL, ch );

	   ch_printf( ch, "[Area Flags: %s]\r\n", flag_string( ch->in_room->area->flags, area_flags ) );

	   set_char_color( AT_IMMORTAL, ch );
	   ch_printf( ch, "[Room Flags: %s]\r\n", flag_string( ch->in_room->room_flags, r_flags ) );
	}

      /* Room Sector display written and installed by Samson 12-10-97 */
      if( !IS_NPC(ch) && IS_IMMORTAL(ch) && IS_SET( ch->pcdata->flags, PCFLAG_SECTORD ) )
	{
	   set_char_color( AT_IMMORTAL, ch );
	
	   ch_printf( ch, "[Sector Type: %s]\r\n", sec_flags[ch->in_room->sector_type] );
	}

	/* Area name and filename display installed by Samson 12-13-97 */
	if( !IS_NPC(ch) && IS_IMMORTAL(ch) && IS_SET( ch->pcdata->flags, PCFLAG_ANAME ) )
	{
	  set_char_color( AT_IMMORTAL, ch );
	  ch_printf( ch, "[Area name: %s]  ", ch->in_room->area->name );
        if ( ch->level >= LEVEL_CREATOR )
          ch_printf( ch, "[Area filename: %s]\r\n", ch->in_room->area->filename );
        else
	    send_to_char( "\r\n", ch );
      }	

   Then locate function do_config and find the following code:

      if ( IS_IMMORTAL( ch ) )
      {
	set_char_color( AT_DGREEN, ch );
        send_to_char( "\r\n\r\nImmortal toggles:  ", ch );
        set_char_color( AT_GREY, ch );
        ch_printf( ch, "Roomvnum [%s]    Automap [%s]",
	  xIS_SET(ch->act, PLR_ROOMVNUM ) 		? "+"
							: " ",
          xIS_SET(ch->act, PLR_AUTOMAP  ) 		? "+"
							: " " );
      }

   Directly below that, add the following code:

 	/* Config option for Room Flag display added by Samson 12-10-97 */
	/* Config option for Sector Type display added by Samson 12-10-97 */
	/* Config option Area name and filename added by Samson 12-13-97 */
      if( IS_IMMORTAL( ch ) )
      {
	  set_char_color( AT_DGREEN, ch );
        send_to_char( "\r\nMore Immortal toggles:  ", ch );
        set_char_color( AT_GREY, ch );
        ch_printf( ch, "Roomflags [%s] Sectortypes [%s] Filename [%s]\r\n",
        IS_SET(ch->pcdata->flags, PCFLAG_AUTOFLAGS) ? "+"
							          : " ",
	  IS_SET(ch->pcdata->flags, PCFLAG_SECTORD)   ? "+"
							          : " ",
	  IS_SET(ch->pcdata->flags, PCFLAG_ANAME)     ? "+"
								    : " " );
      }

   Then a little further down, locate the following code:

	  else if ( !str_prefix( arg+1, "nosummon" ) ) bit = PCFLAG_NOSUMMON;
          else if ( !str_prefix( arg+1, "gag"      ) ) bit = PCFLAG_GAG; 
          else if ( !str_prefix( arg+1, "pager"    ) ) bit = PCFLAG_PAGERON;

   Directly below that, add the following code:

	    else if ( IS_IMMORTAL ( ch )
               && ( !str_prefix( arg+1, "roomflags" ) ) ) bit = PCFLAG_AUTOFLAGS;
	    else if ( IS_IMMORTAL ( ch )
		   && ( !str_prefix( arg+1, "sectortypes" ) ) ) bit = PCFLAG_SECTORD;
	    else if ( IS_IMMORTAL ( ch )
		   && ( !str_prefix( arg+1, "filename" ) ) ) bit = PCFLAG_ANAME;

2. Open mud.h and locate the section called: /* Bits for pc_data->flags. */

   Add PCFLAG_AUTOFLAGS, PCFLAG_SECTORD, and PCFLAG_ANAME in the next available BV slots.

   Then locate the following code:

extern	char *	const	r_flags		[];
extern	char *	const	w_flags		[];

   Directly below that, add the following code:

extern	char *	const sec_flags		[];

3. Open build.c, and locate the following:

char *	const	pc_flags [] =
{

   Add "flags", "sector", and "aname" to the spots that match up with the BV slots
   you used in mud.h

4. Make clean, recompile.

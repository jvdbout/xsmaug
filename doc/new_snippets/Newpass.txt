What this code does
-------------------

This command allows immortals with sufficient access to change the
passowrds of players without having to hassle with the formpass
command. Can be used in conjunction with the loadup command to
reset a password someone forgot, or to deliberately change the
password of someone you intend to punish. Because this allows you
to do so, it should only be granted to high level trusted admins.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1. Copy the following code into act_wiz.c, or whichever file you prefer.

If using standard Smaug, without the MD5 Password code:

/* Password resetting command, added by Samson 2-11-98
   Code courtesy of John Strange - Triad Mud */
void do_newpassword( CHAR_DATA * ch, char *argument )
{
   char arg1[MAX_INPUT_LENGTH], arg2[MAX_INPUT_LENGTH];
   CHAR_DATA *victim;
   char *pwdnew, *p;

   if( IS_NPC( ch ) )
      return;

   argument = one_argument( argument, arg1 );
   argument = one_argument( argument, arg2 );

   victim = get_char_world( ch, arg1 );

   if( ( ch->pcdata->pwd != '\0' ) && ( arg1[0] == '\0' || arg2[0] == '\0' ) )
   {
      send_to_char( "Syntax: newpass <char> <newpassword>.\r\n", ch );
      return;
   }

   if( victim == '\0' )
   {
      ch_printf( ch, "%s isn't here, they have to be here to reset passwords.\r\n", arg1 );
      return;
   }

   if( IS_NPC( victim ) )
   {
      send_to_char( "You cannot change the password of NPCs!\r\n", ch );
      return;
   }

   /*
    * Immortal level check added to code by Samson 2-11-98 
    */
   if( ch->level < LEVEL_INFINITE )
   {
      if( ( victim->level >= LEVEL_IMMORTAL ) || ( get_trust( victim ) >= LEVEL_IMMORTAL ) )
      {
         send_to_char( "You can't change that person's password!\r\n", ch );
         return;
      }
   }
   else
   {
      if( victim->level >= ch->level )
      {
         ch_printf( ch, "%s would not appreciate that :P\r\n", victim->name );
         return;
      }
   }

   if( strlen( arg2 ) < 5 )
   {
      send_to_char( "New password must be at least five characters long.\r\n", ch );
      return;
   }

   pwdnew = crypt( arg2, victim->name );

   /*
    * No tilde allowed because of player file format.
    */

   for( p = pwdnew; *p != '\0'; p++ )
   {
      if( *p == '~' )
      {
         send_to_char( "New password not acceptable, (can't use ~) try again.\r\n", ch );
         return;
      }
   }

   DISPOSE( victim->pcdata->pwd );
   victim->pcdata->pwd = str_dup( pwdnew );
   save_char_obj( victim );
   ch_printf( ch, "&R%s's password has been changed to: %s\r\n&w", victim->name, arg2 );
   ch_printf( victim, "&R%s has changed your password to: %s\r\n&w", ch->name, arg2 );
   return;
}

If using Smaug WITH the MD5 Password code:

/* Password resetting command, added by Samson 2-11-98
   Code courtesy of John Strange - Triad Mud */
void do_newpassword( CHAR_DATA * ch, char *argument )
{
   char arg1[MAX_INPUT_LENGTH], arg2[MAX_INPUT_LENGTH];
   CHAR_DATA *victim;
   char *pwdnew, *p;

   if( IS_NPC( ch ) )
      return;

   argument = one_argument( argument, arg1 );
   argument = one_argument( argument, arg2 );

   victim = get_char_world( ch, arg1 );

   if( ( ch->pcdata->pwd != '\0' ) && ( arg1[0] == '\0' || arg2[0] == '\0' ) )
   {
      send_to_char( "Syntax: newpass <char> <newpassword>.\r\n", ch );
      return;
   }

   if( victim == '\0' )
   {
      ch_printf( ch, "%s isn't here, they have to be here to reset passwords.\r\n", arg1 );
      return;
   }

   if( IS_NPC( victim ) )
   {
      send_to_char( "You cannot change the password of NPCs!\r\n", ch );
      return;
   }

   /*
    * Immortal level check added to code by Samson 2-11-98 
    */
   if( ch->level < LEVEL_INFINITE )
   {
      if( ( victim->level >= LEVEL_IMMORTAL ) || ( get_trust( victim ) >= LEVEL_IMMORTAL ) )
      {
         send_to_char( "You can't change that person's password!\r\n", ch );
         return;
      }
   }
   else
   {
      if( victim->level >= ch->level )
      {
         ch_printf( ch, "%s would not appreciate that :P\r\n", victim->name );
         return;
      }
   }

   if( strlen( arg2 ) < 5 )
   {
      send_to_char( "New password must be at least five characters long.\r\n", ch );
      return;
   }

   pwdnew = smaug_crypt( arg2 );

   /*
    * No tilde allowed because of player file format.
    */

   for( p = pwdnew; *p != '\0'; p++ )
   {
      if( *p == '~' )
      {
         send_to_char( "New password not acceptable, (can't use ~) try again.\r\n", ch );
         return;
      }
   }

   DISPOSE( victim->pcdata->pwd );
   victim->pcdata->pwd = str_dup( pwdnew );
   save_char_obj( victim );
   ch_printf( ch, "&R%s's password has been changed to: %s\r\n&w", victim->name, arg2 );
   ch_printf( victim, "&R%s has changed your password to: %s\r\n&w", ch->name, arg2 );
   return;
}

2. Add the appropriate entries in mud.h and tables.c for do_newpassword

3. Make clean, and recompile.

4. Add a 'newpassword' command.

5. Add the included help text to your help.are file.

Suggested helpfile entry:

109 NEWPASS NEWPASSWORD~
Syntax: newpass <player> <new password>

This command allows you to change a user's password if necessary.
It should ordinarily only be used if the player is requesting this
help for some reason. Though it can also be used as a form of
disciplinary action against particularly nasty players. The command
informs the player of the password change if they are online at the
time.

If the target character is offline, then they will need to have
their pfile loaded into the game using the 'loadup' command first.

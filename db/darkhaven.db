Several exquisite chairs surround the large oak table, and at times you can find other Augurers here pondering the existence of life, the importance of their daily deeds and anything else that they wish to discuss.  The air in this room is still, and sounds from the outside are not readily heard from this tiny room which seems to be shut off from the rest of the Guild of Augurers. }"

The Chamber of Bounty is a darkened room, illuminated only by torches fixed to the walls held by antiqued sconce holders.  All around you lie items donated by your fellow guild members, and those items that may seem useless to one may be invaluable to others.  Precious armours, treasures and pieces of magic lie here, and more are certainly welcome to be donated for use by other Augurers. }"

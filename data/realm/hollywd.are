it is time to buy a 35mm and cash in on them.

ExDesc       This area created by Yaegar in January 1996. It is a collage of scenes from
his favorite (and not-so-favorite) films. The sets are thrown together semi-
randomly, as it is on a film studio lot, where you can walk from a scene of
polar exploration into a roaring inferno. There are lots of high level aggies,
so be careful, but they are sentinel, so you need only use scan (and common 
sense) to detect them.

Have fun!

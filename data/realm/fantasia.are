Desc      Falkor is a luck dragon. He is very large, extending almost the length of
a football field from his muzzle to the tip of his tail. He stands about
a story high, with confidence, yet with an aura of compassion about him.
His eyes are large as well, ruby red in color. However, they are not 
piercing, they are more warm and kind looking. His scales are the purest
white you've ever seen, and shimer like the clearest ocean ever could.

Desc      The Empress is sitting comfortably in the middle of the room. Her hair is
neatly combed back against her head. A thin, silver tiarra settles on the
top of her head, drawing to a "v" in the middle of her forehead. Her eyes
are a bright blue, surrounded by long, black lashes. Her cheeks are slightly
rouged and her lips are full, and red. She is wearing a long white gown
that hangs from her shoulders with silken sleeves that draw to a "v" at
the top of her hands. The dress it self is fit tightly across her torso
but blossoms out at her hips, coming to a full and extravagant drape
over her lower half. There are beads and diamonds strewn all throughout
the fabric, seemingly giving her a slight glow.

with cement walls, painted gray but chipping. There are wooden crates
lining the walls, and a various assundry of long tables and heavy machinery.
There is little light, even from the windows that are high upon the walls.
They appear to have been spray painted over with black paint. It's almost
as if someoene was trying to hide something in here. The air is thick and
musty, making it hard to breath. There are footprints on the dirty floor
that appear to be recent.

sign on the wall reads "The Attic." To the east and west are more hallways
with several classroom doors along the dingy walls. There is hardly any
sound to be heard here. The florescent lighting doesn't do much to pep up
the mediocre surroundings.

to tell you about the cure for the Empress. Hopefully, she has the answer

The wind has died down once more, and things seem strangely calm. Almost,
too much so. The ground is still sand, which makes it somewhat difficult to
trudge through. Looking around, it seems to go on forever in all directions.
The sky is dark, but the stars are burning brightly, lighting the area
enough to ensure safe travels... at least for now.

Desc      Finding yourself on the beach, everything seems calm once more. Falkor
however, seems nowhere to be found. The waves roll in gently, and a 
light mist from them tickles your skin. To the east a small abandoned
shelter of some type. It seems to be the only hint of civilization.
There is however, a dark sense of dread as you near it. But what choice
do you really have?

Desc      The air here is thick, almost putrid. The walks are black, and crumbling
in decay. There is little light, and absolutely no air movement. You can
see that the lair extends to the north, but it is suggested you turn
back the way you came, for only your demise awaits you ahead.

Desc      And you entered, despite the warning. Here is Gmork, the servant of The
Nothing. There is nothing but darkness here. No light. The dark is 
thick, and it seems to be entering your very veins, overcoming and
surging throughout your body. All hope seems to have disappeared, and 
there is only emptiness and indifference remaining. What a terrible place
to die. Alone, and probably never to be found.

Desc      This is the main stage area where the Empress would address the people
of Fantasia. The stage is made of ivory, there are bergundy velvet
ropes adorning the edges of the stages. A small podium is just off to
the right, made of the same ivory, with a strange symbol cut into it.
The symbol seems to be two intertwined snakes, one black, one white.
There is a small doorway toward the back of the area, it seems to  be
the enterance to where the Empress resides. Above the doorway, carved
into the ivory is a phrase "Believe In Your Dreams."

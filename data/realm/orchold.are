trained on the ground below. The path runs directly north, crossing

enter their watery lair. You shudder and prepare to press on.

enough to allow creatures of medium height to walk underneath without
impedement. It is almost as if the inhabitants within were expecting
someone or something's return; undoubtedly not an adventurer, however!

whatever resides within is not exactly a stickler for cleanliness and

indicating frequent usage by some assortment of creatures. The smell
is stronger here than outside, and is now mingled with a far more
unpleasant, but uncomfortably familiar, odor; that of orcs.

worn the stones smooth here, evidence of habitation over a long period.
Despite this, the stair appears to be in good condition; evidently the

Desc      In a grossly ostentatious display, the original inhabitant of the
tower placed a golden throne for his or her seat at the end of the table.
It is covered in blood stains, and you presume that whoever commissioned
it as a seat also unconsciously used it as a death bed. Large grooves
mark the floor to either side of the throne, as if something heavy had been
dragged along it but recently.

that winds up to a secret area of the tower. It is more than likely that
the most powerful residents of the tower may well reside here, but to 
balance the unease of that thought is the notion that where there are
powerful foes there is usually also an abundance of gold and gems.

dozens of orcish weapons, all of inferior quality to your own current
weaponry. Boar hide helms rest atop long stakes that have suits of leather
armor bound to them, most of them badly stained. Another locked door bars
progress north.

Desc      This chamber is bare save for three container arranged about a small
wooden table, the purpose of which is not clear. A musty odor pervades
this area; obviously this room is not visited often, or maybe it has yet
to be visited by the orcs, as the chests are of obvious human design yet
bear no signs of violence. Yet another door lies to the north. It is a 
simple affair, of plain wood with no bands.

lies to the west, while foodstuffs are stored to the east. A vile odor
emanates from both directions. A heavy oak door blocks passage north,
into the tower cells.

Desc      Your stomach almost rebels as you enter the stinking cesspit that
serves as the food preparation area, in the most general sense, for
the garrison of orcs quartered below. You have been in cleaner (and more
pleasant) sewers than this slop hall. Orcish cuisine has never been 
regarded as particularly wholesome or healthy, but the standards of this
kitchen have succeeded in bringing it to even lower depths. You try not
to look at the half-disemboweled halfling still writhing feebly on the
filthy benchtop, his guts being slowly drawn out and into a bubbling pot
by a greasy orc chef.

the next meal, a victim for a night's whoring, or maybe they await the

a stout iron trapdoor, closed but not barred (the orcs figured out they
couldn't get back in from the roof when people barred it, so they removed
the bindings). You think you can hear someone or something talking up on
the roof, though the thickness of the portal prevents much noise from 
issuing downwards.

soar, and you almost laugh out loud as you gaze out over the beautiful
vista that stretches around all sides nearly eighty feet below. Far to the
east you see the tall trees of the Dark Forest, while to the south the 
main highway of Estroglia ribbons towards the spires of Maritshome, jewel
of the Ocean of Dreams. To the west the forbidding slopes of the Kore beckon,
and beyond them the great Walls of Defiance border the northern frontier
of the Empire. The mighty Phlugistrum slashes through the land as of the
wake of a razor slashing through skin; were human blood blue, the effect
would be chilling indeed! Smiling, you turn to gaze northwards once more,
and halt in your tracks as you see several large orcs staring at you...

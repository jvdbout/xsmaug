cover this creature.  They look hard.   The beasts hands end in large,
sharp looking claws.  It does not look happy to have visitors.

Desc      This  dwarf  has  been  lost down here for some time.  He is typically
short like most dwarfs.  Heis typically stout, again, like most of the
other dwarves you have seen.   His beard hangs down to his waist,  and
is somewhat tangled.   Atop his head he is wearing a brilliant diamond
studded helmet, and in his stubby hands  a  great battleaxe is wielded
tightly.  There is a look of determination in his aged eyes.  While  a
fearsome looking opponent, this guy is getting up in the years and has
passed his prime.  You think you have seen this fellow somewhere else.

Desc      You cannot help being sorry for this pathetic creature.  This  mob  is
representative of all the 'do nothing' immortals, who in the course of
their fun-time feel it is required  of them to make laws that alienate
players and working immortals alike.  We all agree rules are important
to the survival of any organized group of individuals, however,  it is
usually the case that the ones making the rules actually contribute to
the greater good of the organization.   This mob can't build, does not
know jack about coding, probably could even manage to make a social if
their life depended on it, and wouldn't have a clue about fucking with
skills. All they know is freeze, hell, siteban, and of course, balzhur
all of which they use to overcome their insecurities in real life.  As
a player you will never see this mob, and consider yourself lucky.  If
you are an immortal,  take heed, there are words of wisdom to be found
here within this description.

it was with a band of adventurers.   After only a few months of travel
he returned with 13,000 gold pieces worth of rope.  In  turn  he  sold
the rope at  a  profit, and is one of the richest dwarves in the clan.
This is a true story, well, as true as one can be in this setting.  I

at least wide enough to stand a dozen or so men  side  to  side.  Upon
observation, you note that there is  a  short mine-cart track ahead in
the large tunnel,  but not here,  leading out of the mine.   Obviously
whatever is mined is also processed within the immediate area as well.
To the south through an archway you see the entrance to the mines.

been chipped about  to  reveal  precious  metals  and  gems,  not  for
asthetical reasons but there is  a certain degree of skill even in the
hurried swings of the dwarven miners.  Even  if  you are uncomfortable
underground,  you have little fear of this place falling in on itself.

appears as if the work had just suddenly stoped.  A  vien  in the wall
might  yet  yeild  something  valuable.   After you have examined this
chamber more carefully you can go back this wide passage to the north.

Desc      This passage  is  very small,  even for dwarf standards.  Perhaps this
was only a lead that did not pay off, or perhaps it is a back entrance
to a secret chamber?  Only  exploring  will tell.  The cramped passage
leads on to the north and opens up into the large tunnel to the south.

getting  through  it.  There are  no  indications to what this passage

Desc      This passage does not lead anywhere.  It just ends.  From the marks on
the solid stone wall you guess that this passage had stopped some time
ago,  but you can not be positive about that,  unless you are a dwarf.
The only exit is back to the branching passage, to the west. You could
only hope that something, maybe a small gem, perhaps a nugget of gold,
something.  But no, nothing anything has been left.  Damn dwarves.

Desc      If  you  are  a  miner you have found  a  true  treasure,  the storage
chambers of the dwarves.  All manners  of  picks,  shovels,  lanterns,
grappling hooks,  spikes,  hammers,  you  name  it,  and  it is  here.
Unfortunately there is not a miner class  on  most muds,  so  you will
have to sift through this stuff you  do  not really know much about to
find out if there are any magical picks, or enchanted grappling hooks.
You realize these passages are travelled  by  the  dwarves  every  day
before  and  after work returning their tools.  Once you are done here
you can return to the well worn passage to the east,  unless you could
get the quartermaster to do some trading with you.

bellows which fan the intense flames to the south in what is the large
furance you have ever seen.  There are also anvils along with tools of
the trade found all about this  chamber.  To  the south there are many
openings into the furnace, although it is not advisable to enter them.
To the west is a large pool  in which water is fetched and then placed
in smaller troughs beside the anvils and workstations.   East there is
what appears to be a storage area of some kind. From the looks of this
place, you figure that ten or so smiths could easily work here without
getting in each others way.  To the north  a  stone archway leads back
into the mines.

clear water.   Possibly it is  a  natural undergound water supply, but
it  could have also been carved and filled with water.   Either way it
looks very deep.   The edge of the pool has a half meter stonework lip
to contain the water.   The pool is shaped like  an  oval  and  in the
center of this side chamber.  To the east is the center of the forge.

Desc      This  passage appears  to  have been worked over for some reason.  The
walls are flat, as are the ceilings and the floors.  In the floor here
there is a large set of stairs leading down into a chamber beneath the
passage.  To the south  a  set of mine tracks can be seen in the large
tunnel, while to the north the smooth passage continues.

Desc      Perhaps this passage has something to do with the stone-cutters. It is
hard to understand the love these folk have for working with stone and
metal, or anything to do with the ground in general.   It is something
in their blood you suppose.   The smooth passage leads north or to the
south where a staircase can be seen decending to a deeper level.

purposes. The walls have been worked over to be smooth and archways of
stone have replaced the wooden beams.  Perhaps there  is  something at

stone-work here is amazing.   The floor,  ceiling,  and walls have all
been smoothed perfectly flat.  Circular stone archways  have  replaced
the wooden beams here.  It is obvious that this part of the mine is no

Desc      Here and there young stone-cutters  are  working out the final details
of this passage.  However,  they are young by human standards only.  A
dwarf after reaching maturity can figure at least spending fifty years
of  working  in  the  mines before they can even apply to being a true
stone-cutter.   In addition to simply hacking away at the stone, it is
important  to  play  very  close attention to detail while working the
stone.  The passage runs east and west here.

Desc      The passage takes  a  turn  here.  This part of the mine must have run
dry  a  very  long time ago to have been worked over like this.  Sharp
corners  and  perfectly  smooth  walls best describe this room.  Along
the base of the floor there is a stone footing. Graceful archways have
now replaced the wooden beams here.   Aspiring stone-cutters are given
the  task  of  working  these walls as part of their training.  To the
south the passage appears to come to a dead end.

end is still rough.   It will most likely be expanded when a new group
of  apprientance  stone-cutters  graduate.  You figure it will take at
least another twenty years for  that to happen so you best turn around

leads up to another level of the mines.  The exits to the north, east,

hewn from solid stone and small little rocks are here and there on the

a dwarven mine after all.

Desc      The narrow passage bends  to  the  east and south here.  To get around
the bend you have to really squeeze between the rocks.  This obviously
is not the work of the dwarves.  Probably a natural crack that was too
small for the bulky dwarves to pass through and they never bothered to
repair it.  Perhaps once their problems have been solved they will fix
this crack?  To the east you can just barely to make out a chamber.

even the cellars  to  the  rumor  dwarven vault where they store their
mountains of gold and mithril blades?   Either way that narrow passage
was not made by the dwarves, it looked too natural.   You suspect that
you are not wanted here by the reaction  of  the guardian.  The narrow
passage leads back to the west while an heavy stone trapdoor is set in
the ceiling above.

their best might not be enough.  A natural passage leads up and out of

Desc      Here at a narrow point in the tunnel a pair of orcs are posted to keep
out any intruders or keep in any goblin that is trying to avoid doing
their work.   The tunnel is supported in a few places by wooden beams,
but far too many of the beams  do not look like they are going to last
much longer.   There is something unsettling about exploring these orc
made tunnels.

are just crawling the tunnels.  After clearing the guards stationed at

earth and stone. Maybe exploring these tunnels is not such a good idea

ExDesc       This area is based on the Intellivison game "Advanced Dungeons and Dragons" 
which is of course based on TSR's role playing game.  The name Cloudy Mountain,
the caves in Cloudy Mountain and the mobs in Cloudy Mountain are taken 
directly from the game and credit should be given to Matel Electronics and TSR.
The city/village is from Scourge, summer 1996.  Some mob ideas are from TSR's

With their size and strength along with their intelligence, these soldiers are
superior to soldiers of other armies in every aspect.  With the advantage of a
winged army as well, this battalion is nearly unstoppable.

Desc      This empty room belonged to the human Queen of Cloudy Mountain.  No one 
know for sure how the queen died, but it is generally thought to be foul play.
Although the marriage was widely celebrated publicly, many of the pure dragon
nobles were against the marriage.  It has been rumored that Drakknar committed
this ghastly act, but those who know him well do not believe this.

Desc      You have entered Scourge's private room.  It is rather dark, those of 
good alignment may find it sinister and feel uncomfortable...those who walk
the path of evil are right at home.  There is a roaring fire in the fireplace,
yet the room feels chilly.  There are some plants in the window, but they 
appear to be dead.  Scourge is sitting in a black and red chair, he grins 
at you evilly.

ExDesc       You meet his cold stare, as a chill runs up and down your spine, he speaks.
Scourge says, 'I am not here right now, if you would like to leave a message,
please leave your name, number, and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.'

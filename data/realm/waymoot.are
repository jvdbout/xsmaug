green almond-shaped eyes.  Breaking your gaze from her lovely face, you notice 
a mass of lush, auburn hair that tumbles down her back to her waist. Her pale
skin contrasts sharply with her rose red full lips, quirked into a smile 
which reveals newly growing fangs.  Looking down at the rest of her body,
a curvaceous young body leads you down to her long legs, a tattoo of a vine
twining its way up one leg, disappearing under a teddy that makes you 
gulp.  She laughs a rich laugh at your appraising look and cocks her head 
at you, examining you herself.

upon the bed waiting to be snuggled up under with someone special.  An
intricate carving of a vine heart shaped wreath decorates the dark oak

Desc      As you look around a sense of peace and tranquility comes over
you.  This clearing is surrounded with pine trees that tower far
over your head.  They seem to be one hundred years old.  Above you 
the sky peeks through the tops of the trees, showing the beautiful
heaven above you.  In the furthest corner of the clearing is an
old oak tree.  As you take a closer look you notice there are 
initials carved into the bark of the old tree.  D loves A is what the 
carving says.  The path leads back south.

Desc      You have come upon a small clap board hut, nestled in between the
towering pines.  The path leads up to the front door of the cabin.
Dozens of varied kinds of wildflowers grow around the foundation of the
cabin.  The smell is heavenly and the birds here are certainly more
cheerful.  The path west will take you back through the forest and
continuing east will take you through the front door of the cabin.

on all sides is the most wonderful assortment of sweets you have
ever seen.  The tables and shelves hold glass jars filled to the brim
with wonderfully sticky concoctions.  Behind the counter an old Chesyli 
shopkeeper works hard at dipping strawberries into chocolate.

notice that you're standing on piles of old bones.  Seems to be where the
old Majhar Dragon had kept all the poor souls that he had defeated.
Piles of bones and skulls lie around the cavern waiting for some poor 
soul to take heed of this warning.

Desc      Rising out of the murky waters here is a small island that boasts a
rusted iron gate, which leads into a looming structure to the west.
Despite its size, it is not visible from more than a few feet away,
being as its walls are covered in marsh muck and assorted other 
substances. It is not surprising that you found it hard to locate. The
gate doesn't appear to be locked; peering between the bars you see a 
long stone corridor beckoning...

underfoot, suggesting mold and other substances that grow in a place
that has most probably not felt the touch of sunlight in centuries, if

decaying corpses staked to the slimy walls. Several more corpses, of
elves and goblins, sit skewered about a small unlit brazier at the
junction; the purpose of this is unclear, but you think it wisest not
to meddle. A strong odor wafts in from the northern corridor, while
a keeing wail echoes from the west. Neither sound nor noise can be
detected to the southwest, however, just dark, impenetrable dark, and
silence. Truly this is indeed a lair of Chaos, and you do not doubt that
whatever is the master of this domain will be a potent adversary indeed!

give the impression that they are flowing rivers of blood, gushing in
torrents back and forth along the walls, like the cargo of some inhuman
vein of gargantuan proportions. A dull throbbing, pulsing sound, as of a
heart beat magnified in intensity a hundredfold, echoes back and forth
along the corridor. A chill wind blows in from the east, accompanied by
a fell howling; the resulting cacophony of sound is almost enough to send
you mad.

Desc      As the heartbeat reaches a crescendo, it suddenly halts when you pass
before the gates to the west. Ornately crafted from platinum and onyx,
the unique combination of the two substances gives an impression of age
and grandeur, while the naked, writhing women carved into the frame preserve
Lilith's taste for decadence and wanton excess, especially in her chosen
gender. It is rumored that only a woman may pass safely before Lilith, and
that any man foolish enough to cross her path will be dealt with in 
unimaginable ways. No keyhole mars the gate, nor bar, yet it does not yield to
a gentle push or even a firm nudge.

tunnel that runs north and south, filled to chest height with filthy
water. Swimming would be impossible in this muck; you need some other
way to stay afloat. To the north you can hear the sound of rushing water,
while to the south you can hear nothing.

the debris is disturbed and releases various gasses, as of a dead animal
carcass when it is disturbed.

Desc      At this point water gushes in from the swamps above, pounding down on
the sewerage and driving it through some hidden grates below. The flow
is strong, and much of the water is forced southwards rather than being
able to escape down the tiny drain, thus keeping a decent volume of water
in the sewer so that the refuse may eventually be carried away. Unspeakable
horrors undoubtedly lurk below the grate, and you make no effort to 
investigate further.

Desc      Lilith favors all manner of barbarous creatures as soldiers, guards and
thugs, but none are as impressive to her as the simple, but strong trolls.
Where the minotaurs have cunning and guile, and question orders frequently,
the trolls slavishly obey. Where the ogres and orcs may balk at vastly
superior numbers, the trolls will merely grunt and charge, without any fear.
Clad in rough black plate, and bearing vicious weapons in addition to their
fearsome natural armaments, the trolls are ideal shock troops. Their barracks
are surprisingly clean, since Lilith imposed a death sentence on any who failed
to use the latrines instead of their quarters for any and all waste disposal.
There is a strong odor in the air, however, of animal fur long left unbathed.
The barracks stretch to the north and south, while a stairwell lies to the
west.

this area has been designed to impress and beguile them, obfuscating the
true nature of Lilith from those who foolishly seek her help and affection;
they will find only servitude and death. Several burly minotaurs prowl the
court, keeping a close eye on the proceedings in case anyone manages to
realize the fate that is in store for them. A massive set of banded metal
doors lies to the west, guarded at all times by Lilith's wyrm. Surely these
doors must lead into the haven of Lilith herself!

gilded beams set in the whitewashed ceiling. Giggling noblewomen, enticingly
clad, mingle about here, in the hopes of an audience with Lilith. Evidently
this area has been designed to impress and beguile them, obfuscating the
true nature of Lilith from those who foolishly seek her help and affection;
they will find only servitude and death. Several burly minotaurs prowl the
court, keeping a close eye on the proceedings in case anyone manages to
realize the fate that is in store for them. A massive set of banded metal
doors lies to the west, guarded at all times by Lilith's wyrm. Surely these

staring in horror outwards, beseeching you for help; help that you
cannot give. Only when all Chaos is removed from the universe will these
souls be freed.

any chaotic magic, Lilith is unable to enter this room, nor even to
look within here, even involuntarily. This causes her some small amount
of concern, for enemies of hers may find sanctum here, though she accepts
this as one of the many prices for the power that comes with serving Chaos.

present, but so are several new, wicked implements; the purpose of each
is not clear to you at this time, which is perhaps fortunate. If you remain
long enough, you will undoubtedly see their function demonstrated by the
maniacs that staff this foul chamber. Several mangled corpses, hanging from
large meat hooks that dangle from the ceiling, occasionally swing in front
of you, causing you to duck reflexively and gag.

Lilith's magic; though you do find it curious that such a spectacle would
mean so much to her. Evidently even the Queen of Vampires desires the
thrill of a packed arena. Bounding across the sand towards you is a

opulent chamber, a booth where Lilith and her chosen lackeys recline
and watch the proceedings in the arena without. Soft silk cushions cover
the floor, and intricately woven tapestries hang on the walls. A shimmering
mirror to the east, the point of your entrance, allows her to view the 
battles in the arena.

for those kept here; they rarely live long enough to require any of
these things. The manic scrawlings of countless dozens of prisoners covers
the walls, carved with whatever implement comes to hand; prisoners seem
to have an urge to leave some quantifiable legacy of their existence, even
if no one will ever read these scrawlings, or even care.

clears again. When it does, you find yourself standing in a bleak stone
chamber, devoid of any trappings or furnishings. The walls gleam with
fresh whitewash, and the floor has been polished to a sheen. You feel cold
and uncomfortable in this strange place. You can still hear sounds from the
torture chamber, but cannot see any way back to that place, which is probably
fortunate.
 
A door is set in the west wall, while the chamber stretches to the north.

is nailed to the door, to remind others. Trolls, being capable of
regenerating even whole limbs, aren't particularly impressed by this
punishment, so Lilith keeps an acid bath for the recalcitrant ones amongst

the iron tables they have been tied to, while a bony surgeon wanders
from one to the other, making a casual slice her or amputation there.
Their cries of pain are weak and soft, as most of them have had their
mouths sewn shut and their tongues cut out. Blood spattered implements
awaiting cleaning rest in a metal bin near a gaping hole in the floor,
from which issue a variety of howls and pleas.

many, many others have passed this way, and have fallen here, over the

vampires, has claimed innumerable souls, and their blood coats this seemingly
endless passageway. Mangled, blackened corpses hang from hooks set in the
walls, dripping entrails onto the slick floor. The stench is overpowering;
even a vampire would find the overwhelming presence of blood sickening in
its gross excess. Undoubtedly worse waits ahead.

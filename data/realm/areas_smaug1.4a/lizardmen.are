MPECHO The Slann-Mage Priest says, "This evening I would speak of the Gods and
MPECHO how our church views their aspects. Where we are reluctant warriors,
MPECHO Agrikans delight in war and savagery. Only we can prevent them and their
MPECHO vile god of war from undoing the world."
mpsleep 36
MPECHO The Slann-Mage Priest says, "Of Halea? The pleasures of this world must
MPECHO not distract us from our sacred duties. We must be wary of the Whore of

MPECHO The Slann-Mage Priest says, "Ilvir honors the peace of the Concordant,
MPECHO and causes us no harm. So long as he remains in Araka-Kalai with
MPECHO his foul creations. His followers are typically confused, lacking
MPECHO guiding principles."
mpsleep 36
MPECHO The Slann-Mage Priest says, "And should be kept at sword's length.
MPECHO Morgath and Agrik. We must struggle to unravel each new outrage
MPECHO between these twin gods of destruction. Bukrai has been Morgath's
MPECHO undoing, but we must not allow his downfall to destroy us all."
mpsleep 36
MPECHO The Slann-Mage Priest says, "The High Elves."
MPECHO The Slann-Mage Priest sighs.
MPECHO The Slann-Mage Priest says, "They pose as great a threat as Agrik.
MPECHO For the schemes of his followers often wreak their ill effects
MPECHO long before they are discovered. We must be vigilant lest court
MPECHO intrigue draws us to Naveh's ways."
MPECHO The Slann-Mage Priest smoothes his robes.
mpsleep 36
MPECHO The Slann-Mage Priest says, "We shall not allow Peoni's followers
MPECHO to endure injustice or suffering. It is for The Old Ones's sake

MPECHO we defend the land from turmoil and strife."

A Saurus Standard Bearer is standing before you holding his standard up high.
~
The Saurus Standard Bearer is a ferocious but slow moving and slow-witted
creature. Like all lizardmen, the Saurus Standard Bearer has a thick, scaly
hide which protects it as if it were a form of natural armour. It is in fact
better than metal because it is horned and can not be dented or cut and can
only be damaged by piercing the skin between its scales or the software skin
of its belly.

Giant Scorpion~
A Giant Scorpion~
A Giant Scorpion raises his poisonous tail and points it at you.
~
Giant Scorpions are somewhat of a law to themselves, but through much patience
a few specially training Saurus warriors have managed to control them just
enough for them to be a useful form of attack. The Giant Scorpion itself is
covered in a hard, jet-black skin, which acts as its armour. At the tip of
its long tail, you can see a sharp needle-like spine. This is naturally used
as its main weapon.

A Gigantic Spider~
As a Gigantic Spider crawls towards you, all you can really see are its long, hairy legs.
~
Gigantic Spiders were originally found deep in the Lustria by the first tier
Slann Mage-Priest many years ago. They have now ventured out a little further
into the main land and found refuge in Plains along with their co-habitors, the
Giant Scorpions. The Gigantic Spider itself is black in colour with millions of
tiny hairs protruding from its skin. As you look closer, you can see it has a
set of small, razor-sharp teeth.

Cold Ones are possible directly descended from the prehistoric creatures which
the Old Ones found roaming the jungles of Lustria. Cold Ones are extremely
stubborn and not at all intelligent. Their cold bodies exude poisonous slime

to fight against in battle. As well as this they have savage fangs, ripping
claws and talons and lashing tails and are easily roused by the smell of fresh
blood.

and will obey their instructions diligently, showing that they understand
rather more than might be thought from their appearance. Their long reach
enables them to swing their axes even over intervening ranks of scurrying
Skinks.

Lotl-Botl~
Lotl-Botl, the Saurus Hero, is here leading his Saurus legion.
~
Lotl-Botl and his Saurus legion guard the ancient and most revered Mage-Priests
of Xlanhuapec and the sacred temples of this city. Lotl-Botl has no great
intellect and his tactical skills are negligible but such things are not really
required for a Saurus commander. Lotl-Botl roughly translates as "Very Hard".

Kroq~
Kroq, the Saurus Hero, is here leading his Saurus legion.
~
There are sometimes variations among the spawnings of Saurus, and some
individuals are stronger, tougher or more intelligent than others. These are not
mutations, but naturally occurring variations. Such distinctive and often more
dangerous Saurus warriors tend to become leaders, champions and heroes among the
Saurus legions. Kroq is one such unique Saurus. He is distinguished by his
crocodilian head with his huge jaws boasting many sharp teeth.

Oxayotl~
Oxayotl~
Oxayotl turns and aims his blowpipe right at you.
~
Oxayotl is one of the last of the Chameleon Skinks. This rare breed to Skinks
were more akin to chameleon lizards and geckos than newts, and they therefore
shared a different set of natural attributes to other Skinks. Unfortunately the
entire breed lived only in the Pyramid city of Pahuax and only ever spawned in
the sacred pools of that city. Pahuax was ruined shortly before the collapse
of the polar warp gates and may have been sacrificed by the Old Ones in their
desperate attempts to pre-empt the impending disaster by shifting the shape of
the world. Nearly all the Chameleon Skinks and some other unique breeds spawned
by the Old Ones perished.

Inxi-Huinzi~
Inxi-Huinzi takes one of his poisoned darts from behind his shield and aims it at you.
~
Inxi-Huinzi is one of the most cunning and persistent of the Skink leaders who
made assaults on the upstart colony founded by the Norse. No one would have
bothered the Norse of Skeggi had it not been for their greed for gold. The
colony became a haven for plunderers, eager to get their hands on the sacred
relics of the Slann. Inxi-Huinzi was appointed to lead the cohorts of Skinks
issuing forth from Hexoatl to do battle with the invaders and drive them back
to the sea.

Itzi-Bitzi~
Itzi-Bitzi glares coldly at you with his deep penetrating eyes.
~
Itzi-Bitzi is one of the cleverest commanders of Skinks ever to serve the
Mage-Priests of Lustria. With determination and skill he exploited the natural
stealth and skirmishing skills of his Skink cohorts to seal the doom of many
raiding expeditions, intent on the pillage of sacred relics. The annals of the
Old World, Araby, Cathay, the High Elves and the Dark Elves and the Norse Sagas
are full of adventurers who set out for Lustria never to return. Itzi-Bitzi
knows where their bones lie, picked clean by the geckos of the swamps, the red
ants and the carrion beetles.

Tenehuine, Prophet of Solek~
Tenehuine, Prophet of Solek, is here meditating.
~
Tenehuine is the prophet of the serpent god Sotek. This god was destined to
emerge as the pre-eminent cult of the Lizardmen. Originally, the Prophecy of
Sotek was only known in the city of Chaqua. When the Skaven plagues ravaged
Lustria, the city was strike. The Mage-Priests of the city died in the plague,
and the Red Crested Skinks who served them were left leaderless. At that moment
Tenehuine took the sacred golden prophecy plaque of Sotek from the Pyramid
temple and made it into a totem standard. Then he led the Red Crested Skinks
on a great migration, proclaiming the coming of Sotek to rid Lustria of the
evil rat spawn, the Skaven.

Lord Mazdamundi contemplates the glyphs of the Old Ones.

Lord Mazdamundi is a Mage-Priest Lord, who normally resides in the Pyramid
city of Hexoatl. Lord Mazdamundi seeks only to maintain the original world
plan of the Old Ones which was left unfinished when they all mysteriously
perished at the time of the collapse of the polar warp gate. At that time,
Lord Mazdamundi was newly spawned and was still yet a tadpole in the sacred
pond of Hexoatl. He was instructed by the Slann Mages of the first spawning,
before they also perished, perhaps in magical duals against daemons invading
through the collapsed portal.

Looking down from this section on the Pyramid of Sotek, many citizens of Itza
can be seen running around doing their daily business. Several troops of Skink
and Saurus warriors march up and down the streets, making sure order is kept
as well as providing a defense mechanism against any rogue bandits that may
venture through the swamp into Itza.

build such a monument. Few civilizations these days could even comprehend how
to build such as Pyramid, let alone complete one in the relatively inhospitable
region of swamp land that surrounds Itza.

was first destroyed many years ago, there was a lack of natural resources,

to build a new temple far from this location rather than to regenerate this
decaying area.

Lizardman Lane~
This part of the road rises slightly up a small hill and as such it makes
this a good vantage point that enables you to see much of the city of Itza.
The huge Pyramid of Sotek can be seen to the west, whilst the smaller, but
still magnificent Pyramid of Lord Kroak can be seen to the east.

Lizardman Lane~
This eastern side of the city of Itza is known as a place where many
lizardmen practice mystical new age arts that have been brought to Itza
from some of its travelers from far off lands. Despite the current
Slann Mage-Priest's best efforts to promote the use of new skills and
crafts, many lizardmen find it hard to adapt to such radical changes and
they often resort back to their old ways of thinking.

general direction of the Pyramid of Lord Kroak and Skink Barrio South. To
the east, you can hear the sounds the water being splashed about and the
dulcet tones of groaning lizardmen. Perhaps this is emanating from one of
the many spawning ponds that exist in the city of Itza.

to the south, Sotek Street to the north and Itza Road to the east. A little
way to the west, there is a strange dark-looking monument or shrine, somewhat
that resembles a well.

You wander on further through town wondering if this road really leads
anywhere or not. You can see a few shops aligning the roadside, one of
which is a weaponsmith and the other a winery. The smell of grape and
wine intermingles with the damp swamp air to produce a strange musk odor
and the clanging of metal on metal can be heard as the weaponsmith works
away on his latest weapons of destruction.

for miles. As you look around, a small lizardman child runs straight into
you. He looks up and you can runs away screaming, flailing his arms about

You can standing at the center of this main road that leads westwards away
from the city of Itza. The magnificence of the glorious white marble road
surface reinforces thoughts you have had that the lizardmen race is a
truly advanced people although having the tendency to sometimes slip back
into more primitive ways of life and behavior.

A little way to the north, you can see what appears to be a shrine or some
type of small temple, however it does not seem to be of Lizardman design.

of the lizardmen citizens of Itza live. The Barrio is much like any other
community where many people dwell. It is over-populated, crowded, noisy
and in many cases, dirty. It is also known that a certain seedy element
dwell in such places and this means that crime can be an issue that the
authorities need to deal with on a daily basis.

place to sacrifice animals in the hope that the serpent god Sotek will
see their divinity and righteousness and that they will one day return

A Spawning Pond~
In keeping with the existing structures of the historic city of Itza,
the spawning pond is made from a timber-frame, built employing natural
materials, including lodge pole timbers, cedar shingles and decking.
Mature lizardmen females enter this pond from the east via an adjoining
ladder and with luck, they give birth to their babies in the murky swamp
water that fills the pond.

A Spawning Pond~
The water in the spawning pond is dirty and murky. Floating on the water
top, you can see lilies and other pond plant life moving from side to
side as the water ripples around. Small water insects swim around in the
water and provide the lizardmen babies with a nutritious food source.

A Spawning Pond~
The water in the spawning pond is teaming with life, from tiny microscopic
bacteria and algae to small aquatic insects to larger fish. Strange screams
and groaning can be heard all around as the lizardmen of Itza undertake one
of their most sacred and important practices - spawning.

Young lizardmen spawns leave the pond via a wooden platform to the north
and head their way to the east towards the city of Itza. Hopefully the
young lizardmen females will return several years later to begin the entire

You are standing at the heart of Skink Barrio North, a place where many
of the lizardmen citizens of Itza live. The Barrio is much like any other
community where many people dwell. It is over-populated, crowded, noisy
and in many cases, dirty. It is also known that a certain seedy element
dwell in such places and this means that crime can be an issue that the
authorities need to deal with on a daily basis.

A Trail in the Swamps~
Kilometer after kilometer of stinking bogs overlain by a swirling mist that
clings to the skin and chills to the bone...that is the swamp of the lizardmen.
Ahead, a decrepit causeway rises a few centimeters above the fetid waters and
meanders its way through the twisted forms of stunted trees into the depths
of this forsaken land. To the east the fog becomes thinner. There is an old
wooden sign.

Kilometer after kilometer of stinking bogs overlain by a swirling

swamp of the lizardmen. Ahead, a decrepit causeway rises a few
centimeters above the fetid waters and meanders its way through the
twisted forms of stunted trees into the depths of this forsaken
land. The fog becomes thinner to the west. There is an old wooden sign.

A Trail~
On this section of path, to your north, you can see the small harbour of
Itza. All kinds of fishing boats are there, waiting to take to sea. A
strong smell of fish comes from nets that were put out to dry. To the north
you can see a small island but the fast flowing rapids that surround the
island make it impossible to reach. A huge volcano comes out of the water
a little more to the north. The path continues to the west.

The dense fog and the thick vegetation make it nearly impossible for you
to see more than a few meters ahead. From time to time you hear the sound
of an unknown animal moving in the surrounding water. Shadows seem to move
just out of your reach. You see light to the south. The ground under your feet
seems a little firmer.

A stone building stands before you on an island. There are a lot of
lizardmen footprint around it. You see light coming from the open doors.
The walls are covered by crude sculptures showing lizardmen worshiping a

Quicksand!~
You waited too long to move. Now it is too late. You can do nothing as
you are dragged down into the mud. Soon your head disappears under the
water and you meet your end.

Entrance of the Lizardmens' Temple~
As you look at the great bronze doors before you, you notice that
the sculptures on the walls and gates are showing creatures that
look like lizardmen. The figures seem to appear older and more
civilized than the lizardmen who live around the swamp, which have
a more accentuated draconic look.

51 Garden~

Centuries ago, the evil mage Arokal, whose power rivals the gods themselves
built a massive citadel hidden within an enchanted forest. The insane wizard
was corrupted by his power, which made him go mad...causing him to do things
unheard of, even amassing an army and waging war on the deities of the realms.

This would disrupt the balance of all creation...

A small group of heros combined their power and managed to seal him away
in his citadel. Many generations later, the citadel crumbled, but the magic
imbued within the land caused a beautiful garden to spring up in it's place.
Many patrons of the lost eden reside there now, however they cannot leave the
cursed grounds. They pray that one day, another hero might find them and banish
the evil spirit of Arokal that still haunts his old palace and save them from
thier immortal prison.

say Long ago, this garden used to be a grand palace owned by a powerful
say wizard named Arokal. He spent many centuries weaving his magic
say into this palace, making it the envy of all who beheld it.
mpsleep 3
say Soon, after he had finished, he realized that time had taken it's
say toll on his body, and he was dying. This was very troubling, so he
say spent his last few days preparing a ritual to invoke an evil spirit,
say which he could bond his life force with, thus, becoming immortal.
ponder
mpsleep 5
say The ritual went awry at some point, and although he became immortal,
say his soul became tainted by evil. Soon after, his corruption spread
say throughout the land, causing much pain and suffering.
stare
say Several years later, three heros stepped forward, and attempted
say to stop Arokal. The gathered many warriors from around the realm to
say take up arms against this evil menace. The war waged on for
say a year and a day, causing much of the great palace to be destroyed.
sigh
mpsleep 3
say The heros were losing the battle very quickly, and decided to 
say forfeit their lives to save the others. With the help of a local
say mage, they trapped their sould within three stones representing
say the main aspects of life : Creation, Chaos, and Balance.
hmm
mpsleep 3
say The mage also created 10 seals, each imbued with a special power.
say When combined with the seals, the stones can be used to create
say a powerful rune, which was used to utterly destroy Arokal for all
say eternity. Sadly, he was murdered by the evil mage's assassins before
say he could give the warriors the last rune...they succeeded in
say destroying Arokal...or so they thought, but he is back now. Without
say the last seal, the ritual cannot be completed properly and the
say evil will keep returning. All has been peaceful until now.
say The magic imbued within these grounds caused this beautiful garden
say to appear. It has been peaceful for a long time, but now the
say great evil has returned. Please, search these lands and find the
say seals, along with the stones, so we can destroy him forever!
em look solemn for a moment.
mpsleep 3

say of it. Ask the people here about it. They are a friendly lot, just

Continuing on the path, you arrive in the southwest portion of the garden
square. The small grove of trees surrounding it are extremely dense,
and act as a barrier between the fields and hills. Several stones
lay scattered about here, some quite large, and one in particular catches
your eye.

is rivaled by no other. The dirt path that you have been following leads 
in all directions, west and east taking you to the larger sections, 
while north goes toward the center.

You have reached the garden center. An illustrious fountain towers several 
feet above you. Birds fly high above and the sun's radiance shines pleasantly.
There are many ancient stone pillars and crumbled statues strewn about, this
garden may have once been a large palace. Who would have lived in such splendor
and wealth? You notice several paths that lead to various parts of the garden. 
Scanning the horizon, you notice that the weather is much different in
the other areas...

A Large Sinkhole~
As you walk towards the northwestern corner of the garden square,
you stumble across a VERY large sinkhole. It's at least 20 feet across.
You see parts of a crumbled foundation, but nothing stands on it. The
ground is water-logged, and your boots get stuck several times as you walk
around it. You decide it isn't very safe here, and you continue on, not
wanting to fall in...although an unlucky person might do just that.

The Entrance~
The garden is by far the largest you've ever seen. The path leads on to the 
north for quite a long way, passing through beautiful scenery and you stretch
and relax in the sunlight and take in the fresh, sweet-smelling air.
As you look over the edge of the small cliff, you get a glimpse
of the valley below, and the view is breathtaking. This ancient garden 
is truely a magical place. The path splits in two directions, north
leading into the garden in the smaller part of the valley, and east
heading all the way down to the bottom and through the valley.

A Stone Passageway~
You find yourself in a a small stone passageway. The air is musty and dank,
and you find it hard to breathe. Examining your surroundings, you notice
that the ceiling is falling down, and could cave in any moment, it might be
a good idea to not make any noise, or you might be in trouble...

everything. The walls are crumbling, and it looks like this church has sunken

inhuman. Gold as well as other various treasures are scattered about, but

around the edges, but other than that, there are no visible walls. You begin to
realize that mabye this was planned, as the tower has no roof as well. The 
large pool of crystal water in the center seems to slowly drain down below, 
creating the magnificent waterfall you saw below. The stars shine brightly on
one particular spot, as you follow the beam downward, your eyes meet with those
of a celestial being.

This small hill seems to be the center of the battlefield.
Several broken sword lay strewn about, the sticky black colored
blood of the vile shadows is everywhere. There is a murky
white aura hovering in the air...beckoning you to look at it.

You come to a grassy knoll, which is for some reason, very windy.
The winds swirl about you, and knock you back..you feel different.
These are the winds of change, and they will take you anywhere..even

you examine your surroundings, finding yourself against the far
wall of an ancient crumbling hallway.

come to a thin red carpet the leads northward. Much to your surprise,
this section is very well-kept and seems to have been recently used.
You can see a light to the north, and it reflects of the wester wall, 
causing it to shimmer slightly.

line every wall. Ancient tomes are stacked upon a desk in a disorderly
manner, and behind the desk... a robed figure is studying every line of text.
He seems annoyed that you barged in unannounced.

A Throne Room~
A massive throne stands before you. Nearly 15 feet high, it seems out of
place in this small room. Whoever is large enough to sit there, must be
powerful indeed. Perhaps it would be a good idea to be cautious.
The hallway is back to the south.

As you enter the small circle of trees, your eyes meet with those
of a friendly druid. He sits cross-legged on the groud speaking with
nature, and strumming on a lute. It is quite peaceful here.

It is all and nothing. Neither living, nor dead. Good, evil and neutral

of the unseen. It is timeless, with no beginning or end.

Southern gate of Highmoon~
If it wasn't for the enormous tower reaching up at the clouds, you
would have walked past this city without noticing it. The forest 
complete blocks vision of the walls, that are covered with all 
sorts of vines and flowers.  You take a deep breath and smell the 
forest, mixed with the fragrance of freshly baked bread and sweet 
elven wine coming from inside the gate.

as densely packed as the forest outside the city walls. The smell 
of fresh bread and elven wine seems to be coming from a large 
natural cave to your west.

The inn is packed with customers eating and talking. Altough 
a little dark the inn is lighted with candles, placed into 
small alcoves in the rocky walls, giving it a romantic 
atmosphere. You see a handsome female elf in an open kitchen 
preparing elvish dishes that are making your mouth water. You 
feel the urge to sit down for a good meal.

Inside the Old Jade Tavern~
Looking around your surroundings, you start to wonder...where the HELL are
you?!?!  You can barely make out the old moss covered sign on the wall.  It
looks like it says "Jade Tavern".  The musty smell in the air gives you the
chills and you consider jumping back into the pillar.  There is a small sign
leaning against the wall, and you strain to read what it says.

Down the Dusty Hall~
Cobwebs consume every inch of this hallway.  Your skin crawls from the
disgusting nature of the floors and the bugs crawling along it.  You
try to move quickly to avoid anything that might crawl up your leg.

You come across a couple pool tables that you decide have probably seen
better days.  Its obvious that many games have been played on these.  Just
exactly how old is this Tavern anyway?

The Old Bar and Grill~
An inch of dust covers the bar, as you glance over the rows of glasses
once used to hold many a gallon of fine ale and beer.  This bar has been
out of use for a while.  The taps are all dry, and the mirror on the wall
behind it has a huge crack down the middle.  Dont sit on the stools!

Tree of Hope and Despair~
You appear in a place that you had not planned on going. You see
ocean surrounding you, but when you turn around you see an unusual
tree. Half of the tree is full of life and is healthy possible. The
other half is rotting and looks like it will fall apart. The tree
seems to represent a balance in nature. They need each other to
remain standing. With out one the other half would fall into the
ocean.

Standing in the tree you see that there is a line between the hope
and despare where the two merge peacefully. Around the inside of
the tree are stares carved out of the wood. The stairs spiral up
the inside, and just the outside half of them are rotting and the
other appears to be healthy solid wood. The stairs go through each
half of despare and hope twice.

Standing here you can see a clearly see the split in the tree and
how hope and despair affect the tree. The half of despair is bended,
twisted and rotting. The half of hope is perfect in almost every
way. It is strong and healthy. you walk up and touch the half that
is rotting. When you touch it a strange feeling overcomes you. You
look up and you can see the leaves on the top of the tree and the
blue sky.

A small coffin~
You are cramped in what seems to be a small box. The air is stale and
you feel something nasty poking your back, probably some bones. As
you glance around the box, you see the top of a pillar sticking into

The balcony is decorated with figurines of small birds and animals.

An Aztec Temple~
The dense jungle trees crowd around you. Dark green leaves 
and wet vines block out the sky above. Strange noises chatter 
and crash through the underbrush. The sounds of wildlife. A
small stone temple crouches in the shade. It is almost covered
by the moss and greenery that grows over it. Long dead skulls
and bones, bleached white and cracked from age, are stacked
along the temple walls. This area is for high levels only!! Enter
at your own risk!!

The interior of the temple sprawls out to the north. It's golden 
tiles refect the scant light a thousand fold. Reflected rays of light 
bounce off golden idols and statues, cutting through the dusty air.
A red carpet leads into the temple proper and a small hidden door 
leads out into the steamy jungle. This place has a feel of great
age and of long vacancy.

room without shadows at all. Great images paint the walls. The
frightening visages of the aztec gods. Four smaller chambers 
lead off this main room. One in each direction.

The Astral Plane~
White clouds surround your misty body. Some pass through you with
a faint chill. Strange spirits and other astral wanderers float past. Their
silence slightly unnerving. No sounds can he heard across the astral
plane, only a faint feeling of silent echos.

You float across the astral plane. Your intangible body only half visable
even to yourself. White clouds pass through you with an eerie silence.
There are no sounds in this strange plane of exsitance. Spirit shapes
wander aimlessly. Some are people who could not find their bodies to 
return too and are now trapped forever.

A tropical breeze brings the sent of salt and water from the ocean. Small
crabs scurry across the sand, running sideways. Tall palm trees line the
edge of the beach front. Their long trunks casting shadows almost all the
way down to the water. The beach is a calm place and even the newest
of adventurers should have no problem.

water. Small schools of brightly colored fish swim around your ankels.
Starfish, crayfish and other bottom feeders wallow through the sandy
bottom looking for food.

A Fungi Filled Cavern~
Well, you've found the source of the stench.  The next room is
smaller, and is filled with dozens of different kinds of foul smelling
molds and fungi.  Unused to light in this place of eternal darkness some
of the molds and fungi actually begin to shrivel and die when exposed to it.
A man sized mushroom mumbles something and moves away from your light.  What
the hell?

Shroom's Nest~
This end of the cavern is chock full of mushroom matter.  The
spongy material fills the cavern, and the stench is overwhelming.
Little baby shrooms squeak and run from your light as the Shroom
Warriors rush to the attack.

The Murky Pool of Water~
This smaller cavern is almost filled by a spring fed pool of water.
Unlike most such pools in cave systems, this pool is murky, almost
black.  Nevertheless, you get a glimpse of something moving beneath the
water.  What could that be?

In the Murky Water~
You are in a warm and murky pool of water, splashing about blindly.
You feel things...things mind you...moving about in the water around
you, startled by your intrusion.  Its times like these that you wish you
didn't have the adventuring spirit.

Antechamber of a Forbidden Shrine~
You find yourself in the antechamber of a stange shrine.
The only light is from dozens of candles upon the altar, far
to the north.  In the dim light, you think you can see
shapes moving in the corner of the room, or is it only your
imagination?  To the north, worshipers chant quietly,
filling the shrine with their eerie song of worship.

Among the Worshippers~
You step north, and find yourself among the throngs of
chanting worshippers.  Unless most churches, which make
allowances for the comfort of the faithful, there are no
pews, or even mats here, the worshippers kneel upon the
hard, cold, stone floor and pay homage to their deity.  You
feel a strange to continue north, to see the altar up close.

Before the Altar of Bones~
The altar, if you can call it that, is made of the long
bones of the worshippers sacrificed to the Skull.  The
skulls of the worshippers are set in small alcoves in the
walls, each with a lit candle in it's jaws, providing light
for the shrine.  A chill runs up your spine, and you freeze
in a state of absolute horror.

Kaine's Alcove~
This is the small alcove of Kaine, the Skull's chief worshipper,
guard and executioner. He stands here ready to do his master's
bidding.

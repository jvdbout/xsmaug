The Dreadlord watches you impassionately from his throne of twisted metal.
~
Even while resting in his throne, the Dreadlord is a very imposing god. Dressed
in black armor and resting a sword which seems to be moaning acros his lap,
he regards you with utter contempt.  A aura of darkness seems to surround him
causing his image to waver, as if he were only an illusion.  Finding yourself 
at the heart of his fortress, doubts enter your mind, questioning the sanity
of confronting an entity as imposing as Lord Seth.

Dracolich~
Dracolich, the Dreadlord's undead dragon mount, ponders how it shall slay you.
~
Standing forty feet at the shoulders, this great dracolich is the color
and texture of black ivory.  With a majestic air he raises his long slender
neck and roars a challenge to any whom would count themselves his enemy.
His eyes seem to be smoldering rubies, glowing from within his great
skull.  As he attacks, you take notice that his breath of flame
matches his eyes in color...

Dark Gate of the Dreadlord's Fortress~
You stand before the keep of the Dreadlord. The entire structure is built
seemingly from black marble.  Dark vines grow wild upon the walls,
climbing a full one-hundred feet to the battlements.  An eerie silence
pervades the atmosphere, and flickering shadows seem to harbor menacing
creatures ... though from the history of this place, little is as it would
seem...

Foyer of the Fortress of the Dreadlord~
Blocks of a dark marble form square columns which tower into the blackness
overhead.  Footsteps echo loudly with an unnerving distant resonance as you
move forward, and you notice that there oddly is no settled dust upon the
floor, something you would expect from an apparently deserted fortress...
Great archways lift the darkness along both the eastern and western walls,
while the howling wind of the courtyard brings chill air from the south.

Constructed from the same dark marble seen elsewhere in the fortress, its
ends hidden in the shadows, the hallway stretches onward to both the east
and west.  A thick wooden door is recessed into the northern wall, a low
moan emanating from behind its frame.

lie on the northern and southern walls, and from behind the former can
be heard a faint giggle, as if some child were being amused.

A small pile of stuffed animals and dolls is piled in the northwestern
corner of this room.  Shredded stuffed bears and decapitated dolls along
with earless bunnies form a grisly, deeply disturbing scene.  Upon closer
inspection one of the larger dolls seems to be moving.  Indeed, this doll
in the form of a jester is licking a dagger, grinning icily at you...

through this empty space once used as a resting chamber for some visitor
unfortunate enough to have been the Dreadlord's guest.

As you step into the room, your confusion is swept away as the sights and
smells of a training chamber assault your senses.  Rotting limbs lay along
the walls, and splatters of foul green blood criss-cross the walls.  The
main hallway lies back to the west through a large metal door, while a
smaller such door is set into the northern wall.  Either choice might be
acceptable should the ghouls commence a practice of their art upon you.

in design, built for function rather then design.  It would appear
that Lord Seth simply wishes his followers to perform a sacrifice
while in an act of passion...

Bottom of the Shaft~
The bottom of the shaft is dark and windy.  While the gale is always strong,
it alternates between hot and cold, and violently twists the thick strands

The Fount of Power~
You have entered an island of calm in the sea of chaos.  Upon this solid
platform of hard black marble rests a fountain.  Its dark form is beautifully
simplistic, ands its aura of power strong.  No water lies within this
fountain however, but rather a strange, shimmering violet liquid.

Top of the Stairs~
You stand upon a platform outside of chaos, whose only exit that does
not lead back to the Chaos Maze is down.  The stairs are dark, the stone
floor cold, and from below a mournful wail can be heard.  Of course, it
may simply be the wind...

wind is no more, that somehow this ancient place is a barrier even
to the unimaginable power of Chaos.

You have descended to the next level of the Dreadlord's fortress. The
stones here are cut from the same black marble as the rest of his
fortress, but an eerie, dark red whisper of smoke seems to slowly float
beyond the wall. Its movement is hypnotic, and you fear that if you were
to look at it too long it would draw your soul to join its restless
travel.

The Black Dais~
Forming out of the infinite abyss is a dais made from black marble, its
steps leading to up to a platform before a huge double door.  Upon this
dark red metal door are hundreds of molded faces, appearing to be
screaming out in pain.

door doors double damned~
Men and women, children and elders all lay upon this monstrousity. To your
horror, as you pear closer at the door, you notice that the faces are moving
very slowly and with great pain.  It is now that you understand these are the
eternally doomed souls of those who have tested Lord Seth's fortress.  Perhaps
you too will become one of these poor beings...

The Great Hall~
You have entered a large vaulted hall. Gothic columns rise to the dark
ceiling.  In many aspects this room reminds you of the temple in the
first level of this dark fortress.  Here, however, are artifacts from
throughout history.  Strange devices and beautiful works of art are
displayed in a well thought out format.  All these objects seem to be
protected by nearly clear fields of force, preventing a closer look -
and theft.  A large double door leads to the south, and the Great Hall
continues to the north.

The Great Hall~
You stand at the northern end of the great hall.  Gothic colums rise to
the dark ceiling some one hundred feet high.  Works of art and artifacts
of power are displayed here.  From the north a dark chill can be felt,
seeping into your very bones.  The door to the north, while large, is
completely plain.  The Great Hall continues to the south.
To the east and west twin grey doors lead to unknown treasures,
or possibly dooms ...

The Dreadlord's Throne Room~
You have entered the Dreadlord's throne room.  A three stepped dais leads up to
a great throne of twisted metal.  Upon this framework tendrils of darkness
wither up and down the lengths of black metal.  A sound akin to thousands of
voices speaking in a hushed tone begins as you enter the room, threatening
to drive you insane.

The Vault~
Piles of gold coins litter this room.  Seemingly neglected for centuries,
large amounts of dust have settled upon them.  As your light strikes them
the hall is illuminated with a golden light.

Lord Pain's Domain~
You have entered a room similar in appearance to the treasury, but instead
of gold littering the floor, hundreds of devices of pain and interrogation
rest here.  Blood, both dry and wet, covers the equipment, sending a sudden
urge of nausea to your gut.  The moans of those who have died here assault
your hearing.  These voices are not understandable, however, in that all
intelligence has be driven from their minds from by pain they once
experienced here.

smell of death is absolutely terrible.  A few mangled corpses have
been piled in the corner, half-eaten.  This is truly the home of a
horrific beast.

cougar cat mother~ 
a mother cougar~ 
A mother cougar relaxes in the shade afforded by the cave. 
~ 
The cougar's eyes sparkle with wisdom and intelligence. She chooses to 
take the pacifist path, probably in hopes of sparing her nearby cubs the 
hassle involved. Of course, if you choose otherwise, she will by all 
means fight to the death to protect those cubs.

cougar cub~ 
a newly born cub~ 
A newly born cub stares at you with wide eyes, like you're the most fascinating thing on earth. 
~ 
Without a doubt, this is one of the cutest little creatures under the 
light of the sun. Freshly born, he is still very curious about everything 
he sees, including you. At first cautious, he gradually musters up some 
courage and tentatively smells your boots. Liking the smell of them, he 
proceeds to lick them.

a Knight Errant~ 
A knight seeking adventures stands in the middle of the path, blocking your way.

Young, this knight is rash and haughty. But, if his arrogance doesn't 
get him an early grave, he may grow to be a fine knight of great worship. 
But not if you kill him, of course.

His long hair is shoulder length, and his piercing eyes are a deep brown. 
His features are calm but not innocent; it seems like he is unbothered 
by your presence. Well, maybe annoyed; but by no means threatened. With 
a chuckle, he places a hand on the hilt of his sword and draws it. The 
sword, known throughout legends as the Valinspiraller.

it could easily inflict blows from a longer range, giving the unfortunate 
victim no chance to retort.

E 
valinspiraller~ 
A long, thin sword, the Valinspiraller is a mix between a longsword and 
a katana. Runes have been ensorcelled into the surface of the blade, which 
seems to be constructed of perfect diamond. The tip is perfectly sharp, 
enough so to rival the extremity of the finest needle. The edge is no 
worse, making even the finest razor seem bludgeonous. The name 
"Valinspiraller" is inscribed into the handle, which is bound of tough 
but very soft leather.

Castle Gallant Becomes Visible~ 
As though the earth were opening its mouth to yawn, a small canyon exists 
here, full of untamed wildlife and vegetation. The valley provides a 
strategic placement for a great castle, which can be seen to the southeast, 
in the distance. That is Castle Gallant, a castle of elite knights and 
heros of the land. Famed for its exclusive membership of only the top 
notch knights and wardancers, you feel almost certain that the guards at 
the front gates would shake their heads and turn you down.

A Slope Too Steep~ 
The side of the canyon, overgrown with all manner of vegetation, is far 
too steeply sloped to climb straight down, so that it is necessary to 
take a zigzagging path down into the canyon's bottom. There is no real 
path, so the walk is treacherous and dangerous. In times of battle, it 
is virtually impossible for large forces to navigate through this canyon, 
and while they doddle, they can be attacked grievously by all manner of 
projectiles from Castle Gallant. The air here is alive with the songs of 
birds, idly complaining about the weather and trying to woo mates.

A natural cave exists here, worn into the wall of the canyon by various 
conflicting elements and by time. Darkness and shadows are all that can 
be seen within the cave from this point of view, making it's contents an 
unknown mystery. The wind buffets the area consistenly, and can be very 
chilly. The climb along the canyon continues.

A Rather Small Cave~ 
Stones and bones are strewn about the interior of the rather small cave. 
It takes surprisingly little time for one's eyes to adjust to the darkness 
in the cave, and it is clear that it is a dead end. The bones along the 
floor indicate that something lives here. But they are all the remains of 
small rodents and occasionally birds, nothing indicates a genuine danger 
to humanoid beings. Could the creatures who apparently inhabit this cave 
still be around?

Suddenly the indifferent vegetation is replaced by wicked thorns which seem 
to reach out and grab at all passerbies. One has to wonder if these weeds

defenses. In any case, it is all but impossible to traverse the rest 
of the climb without adding another scar, this time from the thorns.

A Small Spring~ 
A small spring gurgles down the side of the canyon, and there is no bridge 
across it so one will have to get their feet wet. It's okay though, the 
spring is less than an inch deep and even a halfling would have trouble 
drowning in it. Here, the atmosphere is so tranquil, one almost expects 
to find a peaceful hamlet around the corner- rather than a massive military 
castle.

Gazing Upwards~ 
This place initially seems very much like a dead end. The massive stone 
wall of the canyon rises up, an impassable obstacle which has thwarted many 
would-be invasions against Castle Gallant. Upon further inspection, the 
clifface is not perfectly smooth, but has jags and niches all along it's 
surface, so it would be possible to climb it. However, a task of that 
magnitude is one to be left to a master climber, not some novice.

A Difficult Climb~ 
This is a truly difficult climb. The wall is not vertical, but actually 
slanted outward just slightly. Indeed it takes a true master of climbing 
to make progress. And from this point of view it is impossible to tell 
just how much further up the top of the clifface is. It could be miles... 
Of course, if you ARE a master climber, you understand the importance of 
concentrating on one perilous inch at a time, rather than think about the 
entire clifface at once.

Hugging the Clifface~ 
The climb continues, and gets none the easier. Without proper climbing 
gear, this ascent is mighty taxing on one's fingers and arms. Each inch 
of vertical movement is a battle, and this is quite literally a very 
uphill battle. In times of war, it would be even worse because knights 
from Castle Gallant would be pouring down such nice things as boiling 
water, large boulders, and of course arrows. 
The wind here is quite fierce, making the climb even more treacherous, 
and worse, making flight out of the question. If one were to try to 
fly up here, the wind would toss them about like a twig, and it cannot be 
doubted that they would plummet to their certain death below. 
A little to the east, a small shelf of rock juts out, probably disaligned 
from the rest of the clifface in an earthquake or similar natural disaster. 
It would be possible to go there to catch your breath.

Just a few inches above, the clifface ends, being replaced by a grassy

Gazing at Castle Gallant~ 
The climb finally completed, Castle Gallant is just a few yards away. 
The castle is wondrous and large, with great towers and parapets, and a 
moat the size of a medium sized river. The castle is a steadfast sentinel, 
a fortress which cannot be penetrated by most any army in these lands. It 
looks as though it comes right out of a faerie tale. Only the most powerful 
of knights and wizards and wardancers dwell within that castle, so proceed 
with caution.

A Knight Errant~ 
Along the side of the path, a small pavilion has been set up. It would seem 
that some knight has come adventuring, questing for a seat at the table of 
Castle Gallant. Turned down, he seeks to prove his metal by jousting with 
passerbies. A nearby tree serves well as a stake to which his steed can 
be tethered, for it would appear that this knight is better at footcombat 
than on horseback.

Outside A Pavilion~ 
A colourful pavilion of a knight errant has been set up here, in the shadow 
of one of Castle Gallant's high towers. The half-open flap of the tent 
flutters idly in the breeze, and nearby, a small dead tree provides a 
perfect opportunity to tether up a horse. To the east, a small path leads 
toward Castle Gallant, but the knight who dwells in this pavilion is waiting 
there to challenge you.

The path is not very well kept; it is falling apart in many places, and

Inside A Pavilion~ 
There is not much to see in this pavilion. The life of an errant knight 
is not one of glamour or luxury. A sleeping bag, some meager provisions,

Approaching the Outer Moat~ 
The sounds of the outer of the two moats of Castle Gallant can be heard 
from here. Actually, only the outer moat is filled with water. While the 
outer moat is the size of a medium sized river, the inner moat is considerably 
less wide; however, in times of war, the inner moat is filled not with water, 
but with lower echelon soldiers! And it takes a really good swimmer to swim 
through THAT kind of moat. From here, you can see that the castle's gate is 
closed.

Before the First Bridge~ 
The wide Outer Moat rushes past. Filled with viscious piranhae, it would 
most likely not be a good idea to leap into the moat. Fortunately, a 
thin drawbridge spans the moat. It is a very thin bridge, so that only 
one person can cross it at a time; it is engineered so that the guards 
on the other side of the bridge can raise it at a moment's notice.

The First Bridge~ 
Watch your balance! The long, wide Outer Moat rushes by below. If you 
aren't careful, you might end up 'fall'ing. And with all the piranhae and 
other nasty things below, you do not really want to 'fall'. That is how 
very many would-be invaders have perished... this moat is an excellent 
shield around the castle, and although it costs alot to maintain, it is 
well worth it. Beyond the bridge, several guards wait.

An Island Between the Moats~ 
A small island exists betwixt the two moats. Actually, the second moat is 
not filled with water at all; in times of war, actual soldiers fill the 
second moat! Though costly in manpower, it is an unbelievably effective 
defensive measure. Rarely has an invasive force even reached the castle 
gates. Speaking of the castle gates, it is clear to see that those gates 
are closed tight right now. Perhaps the castle does not wish to let you 
in; indeed, Castle Gallant is known for discrimination against all but the 
very most elite. Perhaps you should turn back.

The first thing you notice about the murky waters is that they are very

A Dank Prison Cell~ 
A very small cell of cold stone, with hay on the floor, stinks horribly. 
All along the base of the southern wall, there are signs of attempted 
digging, and in one spot there is even a small crack large enough for you 
to crawl through. The straw on the floor is dampened by an occasional 
drip dropping of water from the roof above. The living conditions here are 
utterly intolerable, yet life goes on. 
The cell is enclosed by vertical bars. A single steel door is to the north, 
but the lock is on the other side and the door is magically enchanted to 
resist the passdoor spell.

Like the other prison cells, this one is enclosed by bars, and is adjacent

for some time, but then again, looks can be decieving. There is a bulge 
under the bedding of hay on the floor... upon further inspection, a half- 
rotted body is discovered, filling the cell with a putrid horrible smell, 
in fact filling the whole dungeon with it. This was a grisly fate if ever 
there were such a thing. There is a door to the northeast, but the lock is 
on the other side, and it has been enchanted to resist the pass door spell.

Here in this room, there are a large number of chains attached to the wall,

adept enough to sneak past these alert guards.

The Blade of Justice~ 
Implements of death and destruction are strewn all about this room. All 
have seen quite alot of use, as is evidenced by all the decapitated heads 
piled up in one corner. The stench here is almost unbearable, a stench 
familiar from the dungeons above. The stench of dead, decaying flesh. 
One headless body is sprawled along the floor, still quite fresh and warm. 
>From it's hewn neck, blood still gushes, indicating that this kill was made 
only minutes ago.

The Interrogation Room~ 
This room, surprisingly, contains no diabolic instruments of death. 
Instead, it is filled with instruments which are known to make people 
wish for the relief of death. This is the Gallant torture chamber, where 
many a soul has betrayed secrets sworn to be protected. Few can survive 
the rigours of the Gallant Torturer. He uses strange unorthodox methods 
of "interrogation" and has a great success rate at making people speak.

Climbing Up from the Depths~ 
The stairs continue upward into the higher levels of the castle for what 
seems like forever. It is clear that the dungeons are very deep down 
under the castle, as though the inhabitants of Castle Gallant want to totally 
disassociate themselves from the criminals of their populace. The stairs 
continue still, but now they are not nearly as dark. A small side 
passage to the west leads into some unknown place.

A Side Passage~ 
A very narrow side passage leads through part of the castle, into unknown 
peril. A dim glimmer of light seeps from under a doorway to the west. 
A darkened flight of stairs can be seen to the east. A single unlit torch 
adorns the wall, indicating that this side passage is rarely traversed. 
The floor, uncarpeted, is cold and dusty, with only an occasional light 
footprint to indicate that anyone else ever traverses this place.

A Wizard's Laboratory~ 
A simple study which belittles it's sorcerous inhabitant. There is a 
solid oak desk with some simple papers on it. Glancing at it, hoping to 
see some arcane spells or enchantments, you are disappointed to see only 
some mathematical equations. The room is lit by several torches, and there 
is a simple unassuming chair in front of the desk. All in all, this room 
is quite a let down as far as wizards' laboratories go. 
Also, there is a simple, somewhat dirty mirror set in the west wall.

The Wizard's Mirror~ 
The light in here is dazzling and blinding both at once, being reflected 
an infinite number of times by an infinite number of phantom mirrors. 
Clearly the dirty mirror on the wall of the wizard's laboratory was no 
mere decoration, but the component of a powerful spell, a massive illusionary 
battlefield, which obviously serves the wizard quite well for defense. 
An unexplainable force of bouyance prevents one from falling into the 
bottomless emptiness below... at least it seems bottomless, for if there 
is any floor below, it is well out of sight. It is quite hard to figure out 
exactly which way to go in this place... the light which is reflected so 
brilliantly makes every exit just a blur.

Shadows Among the Light~ 
Natural light flows in from above, yet shadows still prevail here. A sort 
of guard post has been set up, a final defense against escaping prisoners. 
Clearly Castle Gallant places a high amount of emphasis upon the security 
of it's prison. There is no need for torches here, because of the light 
streaming in from the open courtyard. The courtyard which is so close, 
yet still so difficult to reach, thanks to the elite guards who exist here. 
One has to wonder, is this a necessary battle?

The large doors ahead prelude the awesome throneroom of King Gallant. 
On either side of the doors, statues of the king give a preview of the

is little wonder that he has done so successfully in the politics of these 
lands; he is clearly quite charismatic. But it is uncertain whether he

The King's Shadow~ 
Just ahead, the massive throne of King Gallant can be seen, filling the 
whole huge room with a great sense of prestige and honor and judgement. 
Many a man has had his fate decided for him before this almighty throne. 
Men have been made, and lives have been shattered here. With the majestic 
history of this realm, the lives of a few ragtag adventurers does not seem 
that significant. If it is in the king's will that you perish, then you 
will surely perish; that is the power of this monarchy. When the king 
makes a decision, it is carved in stone and solid. There is no escape, 
nor will there ever be.

The Gallant Throne~ 
Awe and majesty are the defining characteristics of this incredibly large 
room. An aura of surpreme power seems to emanate from the throne, and 
it is difficult to determine whether that is by enchantment or simply 
by intimidation; most likely it is both. Every tile in the floor has 
been individually created, and each portrays a great battle which King 
Gallant has fought. Powerful runes cover the walls, offering this 
incredible monarch protection from almost all concievable attacks. 
The throne itself is created of pure diamond, and must have taken a 
century to carve into the perfect shape which it is in. Golden figurines 
of bears and great cats and other beasts of battle adorn the room, 
and each wall is an incredible breathtaking mural of war. The roof is 
opened strategically so as to allow light to stream in in just such a 
way as to land upon the commanding features of King Gallant. The shine 
which thus reflects from his incredible crown is almost blinding.

Forsaken Below the Throne~ 
A cold, damp cell has been created beneath the Gallant Throne. There is 
no exit from this forsaken place, for it is only intended for those unfortunate 
enough to fall prey to the earthquakes summoned by the king. Runes inscribed 
in the walls are engineered to prevent any possibility of escape by magical 
means, so that you are now horribly resigned to the fate of starvation, 
unless perchance your deity can rescue you.

The Queen's Bedchambers~ 
The Queen of the kingdom of Gallant, it stands to reason, is as fine a 
sorceress as any woman in the realms. Her bedchambers are small and not 
very remarkable, with a simple closet, a simple bookcase, and a simple 
but nice blue carpet. The only item which really stands out here is the 
massive bed, surrounded by velvetty red curtains. It is here that the 
queen entertains the king... it stands to reason that it is not good to 
enter this room unless you yourself are the king!

Workplace of the King's Advisor~ 
A small office exists here, filled with plaques and papers stating how 
the person who dwells here has graduated from so many institutions of 
learning. It is clear that such a learn'ed man can be none other than 
King Gallant's personal advisor. It is an honor to be in the presence 
of such a wise individual, and perhaps he can even advise the likes of 
you. It would seem that the King himself has little need for advice, 
already being quite intelligent and wise... so to make himself more 
useful, the advisor runs a small repair business here, exclusively for 
the royal family.

The Fount Most Gallant~ 
You stand by the side of the crumbling fountain. Soft tendrils of music 
stream through the air from the strings of a masterful harper who reclines 
by the fountain's side, singing of the infinite glory of Castle Gallant's 
many worshipful knights. A rather timid looking man, he probably would not 
survive long in battle against the likes of you. It's a good thing for him 
that he's surrounded by strong knights who love him and cherish his music, 
or he would surely be done for, and his golden harp stolen.

A Humble Castle Chapel~ 
A humble chapel has been constructed within the Castle. It would seem 
that the roudy knights make little allowance in their busy fighting 
schedules for the mundane discipline of worship and supplication. 
There are stain glass windows, the beautiful glass portraying battles 
important in the theologies of the major gods and goddesses in these 
lands. The floor is dark black, but not an evil sort of black, but 
rather a comfortable and holy type. There is a very simple altar, but 
it is not really too impressive.

A Dusty Stairway into Silence~ 
As fast as they arose to please your ears, the sounds of the canyon and 
of the softly running spring all die down into a strange hush which 
hangs in the air like a reaper. A very small manmade tunnel leads down 
into a dim cavern below, illuminated only faintly by a few humble 
torches. It is difficult not to cough here, for the air is filled with 
dust which has been collecting for ages and which is just now disturbed 
by the presence of explorers. But upon coughing, very little sound is 
made... it is clear that some powerful magic is present here, making 
the entire tunnel silent. There is nothing but unforgiving earth above, 
as though this were to be your tomb. Mayhaps it shall be, that can 
only be guessed at.

Descent Unbounded~ 
The steps which you have been traversing continue here, with little sign 
of coming to an end. It is difficult to gauge just how far down they 
go, the gloom creating an illusion which makes it seem as though the bottom 
of the steps is always just a few strides below. The steps quiver and 
quake with every move, and one can only wonder how much weight they can 
withstand...

A Precarious Ledge~ 
It is ironic, really, how sometimes the grandest feats of architecture 
are belittled by the simplest natural common objects. This ledge is one 
of those things, seeming insignificant from afar, up close it is your 
lifestring and your lifeblood. Below, there is naught but a transfinite 
fall, an endless agonizing death. This ledge is your only hope at life.

A Truly Horrible Death~ 
Alas, this is a truly horrible way to die. As you fall and fall and fall 
and fall, you eventually grow accustomed to the sensation of falling, and 
after a few days it even seems normal. But there is no way to stop falling. 
Alas, you are doomed to starve and thirst to death before you ever hit 
the ground, a ground which does not exist for this is a bottomless drop.

An Alcove Afrozen~ 
This is a small alcove in the stone, lit only by your own lightsource 
and by nothing else. If one were to look back, it would become clear 
that the tunnel wall was an illusion here, made to protect whatever 
secrets lie within. There is a simple silver altar here, and laid across 
it is the skeleton of a human child.

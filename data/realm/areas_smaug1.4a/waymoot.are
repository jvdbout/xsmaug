Mistress Toreador~
Mistress Toreador~
Mistress Toreador sits quietly while brushing her hair.
~
The first thing about Mistress Toreador that draws your eye, is her bright
green almond-shaped eyes.  Breaking your gaze from her lovely face, you notice 
a mass of lush, auburn hair that tumbles down her back to her waist. Her pale
skin contrasts sharply with her rose red full lips, quirked into a smile 
which reveals newly growing fangs.  Looking down at the rest of her body,
a curvaceous young body leads you down to her long legs, a tattoo of a vine
twining its way up one leg, disappearing under a teddy that makes you 
gulp.  She laughs a rich laugh at your appraising look and cocks her head 
at you, examining you herself.

there is a manor in amongst the trees.

Crossing the stepping stones from the river below you, a blast of mist washes
over you from the enormous waterfall to the north.  Crashing down from
a tremendous height, you are amazed at the swiftness with which the river
dissipates into a mere quiet brook, but the power of the Goddess should
not be questioned.  A large rock slab sits off the side of the waterfalls
pool of water, gently sloping down into the refreshing cool depths. The
rushing river continues to the southwest.

lay think on the forest floor, making your footfalls almost silent.

small clap board cabin in the distance.  Going north will bring you 
upon a clearing.

A peaceful clearing.~
As you look around a sense of peace and tranquility comes over
you.  This clearing is surrounded with pine trees that tower far
over your head.  They seem to be one hundred years old.  Above you 
the sky peeks through the tops of the trees, showing the beautiful
heaven above you.  In the furthest corner of the clearing is an
old oak tree.  As you take a closer look you notice there are 
initials carved into the bark of the old tree.  D loves A is what the 
carving says.  The path leads back south.

Before the Humble Hut~
You have come upon a small clap board hut, nestled in between the
towering pines.  The path leads up to the front door of the cabin.
Dozens of varied kinds of wildflowers grow around the foundation of the
cabin.  The smell is heavenly and the birds here are certainly more
cheerful.  The path west will take you back through the forest and
continuing east will take you through the front door of the cabin.

The Lost Tomb~
Cobbled stone, wet with the dampness of the dark, cool air.  The light
flickers and plays upon the jagged outcropping of the walls.  The whole
surrounding area is starting to look the same.

Waymoot's Tomb~
Deep beneath Waymoot Mountain lies a long forgotten tomb.  The eerie
silence is broken by a rumbling ahead of you.  The walls here have been
rubbed smooth by some unknown force. The cold damp floor shows signs of
something being dragged along..unwillingly maybe?

The Old Majhar's Lair~
An ancient Mahjar dragon makes his residence here.  Some sort of bed
is made up in the furthest corner of the room.  The walls here are also
smooth buy some mystical force.  The damp cool air surrounds you like 
a blanket of fog.  The eerie quiet is broken only by the loud
breaths from the old Mahjar himself.

The Keep~
Beneath your feet, crunching sounds can be heard.  Looking down, you
notice that you're standing on piles of old bones.  Seems to be where the
old Majhar Dragon had kept all the poor souls that he had defeated.
Piles of bones and skulls lie around the cavern waiting for some poor 
soul to take heed of this warning.

Waymoot's Tomb~
Upon entering this hollow chamber your footsteps echo upon the smooth
walls.  A chanting can be heard, coming at you from all sides.  The dirt
floor is swept clean. The walls and roof of this chamber have been honed
smooth.  To the east there is Waymoot's Tomb.

The deep, guttural chanting is slowly becoming louder and closer.  This
part of the chamber seems to be a bit more inhabitated.  Footprints and
lighted torches line the walls.  South will take you back to the 
chamber and west will bring you closer to the chanting.

The Worship Hall~
The chanting is now in tune with your heart, you feel at peace with yourself
and the world around you.  The hall is a grand room with tapestries and a 
large throne at the end of the hall.  An ancient group of people are sitting
upon large pillows.  This is where the chanting is coming from.  Nothing 
seems to disturb their worshipping.  Taking the northern exit will bring
you to one of the chambers.  There is a room west of here.

A small wooden desk, with little adornment, sits pushed up against the

room.  Upon the far wall, above the desk, is a detailed carving of a 
monstrous dragon.  The worship hall is through the east exit.

"monsterous dragon"~
Looking more closely, the intricate carving must have taken years to finish.

for a life time.  This dragon seems to be an all knowing and strong dragon.

Tomb's Corridor~
A chanting can dimly be heard over the rumbling of something that is
coming from the west.  The large cut stone blocks line this passage
causing the light to create interesting patterns upon the wall.  The
west exit will take you through to the Waymoot's Tomb and going further 
north will take you further down the passage.

containing yellow blossoms and still others that hold some sort of
meat.  Wonder what else they have stored in here...

Fortunes Found~
Upon entering the multi-colored tent, you sense that there
is more to this tent then meets the eye.  The lamps are draped in sheer
bright colored fabric. A rotund Homana fortune teller sits opposite 
the entrance to the tent, behind a old oaken table.  The table is draped 
with many layers of the same sheer fabric that covers the lamps.  Upon
the table is one single adronment, the crystal ball.  A small sign hangs
discreetly on the back tent wall.

Quiet Corner~
The sound of a water can be heard in the distance.  The stone walls
echo the sound of chanting, as it seems to be coming all around you.
A few runes have been sketched into the walls, depicting a scene with
an ancient dragon.  The southeast exit takes you to a Forgotten
Tomb.  The exit to the east will take you to the The Fountain.

forth from this fountain in bursts and streams.  A few stone benches 
circle the fountain.  Up above the fountain is a crack in the ceiling that
allows sunlight to filter through.  Growing beside the fountain are 
some sort of roses.

walls.  This room is cluttered with papers and books. The bed is not 
at all comfortable looking.  To the south you will find the fountain again.

only wide enough for one to pass through.  This way seems to be used 
quite a bit.  The stone floor has been swept clean of debris.  The
way to the east will take you back to the Forgotten Tomb.

Looking around you, you notice there are four directions to take.  Both
to the east and the west there are what seems to be doors in the distance.
Looking towards the south there is a hallway that leads into the darkness.
To the north another hollow corridor leads further into the darkness and
a faint rumbling seems to be eminating from that direction.

workbench is situated next to the door. There are small bottles and

north the the rumblings have increased and the walls echo thier calling.
The southern exit is another long hallway.

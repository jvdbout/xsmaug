weredog dog~
A Weredog~
A Weredog sniffs at the ground here
~
This beast almost defies description. It looks like a cross between a
dog and a wildboar. As large as a lion with the agility to match, his
doglike torso is covered with long black mangy hair. His face resemebles
that of a wildboar, with it's huge tusks protuding from it's mouth. The
ability of these creatures to track is legendary and the sound of it's
call makes even the bravest man's blood run cold.

Vohnkar~
Vohnkar the Peck Warrior stands here at his post
~
Like all the Peck race, he stands at only around 4 feet tall. He is dressed
in a brown leather vest and brown leather pants. His black boots are soiled
with mud, as he has just come from working his fields to take his turn at
watch duty. On his side he wears a dagger and in his hand he holds a spear.
You notice a smile form on his bearded,weathered face, but there is also
an air of confidence about him that indicates he knows how to take care of
himself.

Bergulkut is here collecting taxes.

This staunch pompus, balding, Peck is the self appointed Prefect of the
village. With his bullying and badgering, he collects more gold than the
village actually needs. By looking at his clothing and the jewlery on his
hands, it is obvious he is using his post to line his own pockets. On his
side he wears a jewled dagger and in his right hand he holds a staff. It
is rumored too, that he is quite skill with these weapons and he isn't
adversed to show any who doubt his authority.

With his quiet voice and mild nature, it makes it easy to underestimate
this warrior. Among his many virtues though, are an iron will, undying
determination, and a brave heart. Although not the most skilled warrior
in the village, it is these very virtues that make him a most tenatious

turn when seeking the answers to lifes questions, cures for illnesses, or
to enchant thier crops. Although he lives a hermitlike existance, it is more
out of his need for privacy in order to learn and study his skills, rather

This huge half giant/half human is the tavernkeep. His strength and his

Sorsha~
Princess Sorsha stands here poised to attack.
~
Clad in black scale mail armor bearing the crest of Vahlkar, she is a
warrioress, unlike her mother, the evil Queen Bavmorta. Even though she is
a female, she has been trained by the best and is quite able to defend herself
against any who dare oppose her. She wears a winged visorless helmet, which
seems to enhance her natural beauty. In her hand she holds a serrated sword
that she seems to wield quite effortlessly.

As he turns to face you as you enter his chambers his cold hard stare stops

gray bearded, weather worn face. Their effect is almost hypnotic and you
have to shake your head to clear the effect on you. He is clad with a long
flowing black robe that is gathered around the waist with a white silk
sash. On the sash is a leather personal pouch decoated with runic
markings. His long grey hair is brushed neatly back into a long ponytail
that almost reaches his sash and on his feet he wears black leather sandals.

The Bridge~
The bridge crosses a clear blue running stream that flows from east to
west. As you stop to marvel at it's beauty, you notice a large catfish
lying in one of the eddy currents. You wish you had the time to stop
and try your luck, but duty calls and you must be on your way. The village
is south.
There is a Bulletin Board here.

mobs that are aligned with yourself. You may talk with most mobs
that inhabit the realm, but be warned  don't smart off to them.
Your first clue to get U started is "Find the villager that lives alone
 in his dwelling and ask about the Marked Child. The main keyword is
baby or Marked One, so use one of these words when asking mobs. We hope
U enjoy your stay here and may your adventure be blessed.
PS  Be sure to read room descriptions for clues and warnings.

Entrance to Peck Village~
As you enter the village you are at once aware that something is wrong.
Villagers are running every which way, women screaming, babies crying,
and warriors shouting commands. It is pure pandemonium and as you stand
here watching all the chaos around you, you wonder what has caused this.

the middle of all the confusion. A large oak tree dominates the village
square, and as you marvel at it's enormous size, a huge acorn falls on
your head. OUCH!!!! That hurt!!!

Western Lane~
As you continue, you are totally aware of the hackles beginning to rise
on the back of your neck. There are carts of hay and potatoes lying here
overturned and smoldering fires that were quenched by the stews that were
brewing on them before being knocked over by the onslaught of mass hysteria.
A mother clutching her child to her chest, runs past you screaming at the
top of her voice. To the south is a stone building that at the moment
seems closed.
There is a sign here.

As you continue on the western lane of the village you hear the shouts
of warriors from behind you. As they pass you running to the west, you
can't help but notice the determined look on thier faces and the large
spears in thier hands. Obviously there is something amuck to the west, but
should you go to investigate?

are some of the foulest creatures to walk the lands. Hopefully, there was
only one of the ferocious beasts.

wall are a pair of bunk beds and what appear to be cabinets. You can't

a good sign and you look around nervously, making sure that nothing is lurking
on the sides of the pathway just waiting to make you it's next meal.

head on out of town through the gates to the safety of the woods?

that leads off to the south. As you stand here sizing up the situation

unexplained presence here, yet the only thing you see as you scan the
area is a huge tree to the south. You start to amble on towards the
tree and suddenly you almost trip over a tiny white marble structure of
some sort that lies here almost completely hidden by the tall grass.

Sloping Path~
You are on a path that gradually slopes up to the east where you can barely
see the outlines of buildings. To the west the path slopes downward and off
into the distance. The landscape here is pretty much barren with exception to
the large snow covered boulders that are strewn about.
Off to the southeast is a small bungalow with smoke coming out it's chimney.

came into power. Her armies all but crushed most of the Tierrislean army,
the ones that did manage to survive have been scattered throughout the realm.
Here at the castle a garrison of the once proud army resides awaiting for
reinforcements and the opportunity to regroup and to crush Vahlkar forever.

beast and just as it subsides another one answers from within the forest.
There is a wooden sign here.

the trail is leading to higher ground. Looking east the fog seems impenetrable

With the heavy fog limiting your visibility, you hadn't noticed it before,
but you have been resting at the very gates of Castle Vahlkar. The path
leads north or south through the marsh and the gates to the castle are west.

place gives you a sense of dread and despair.

Breaking out into a small clearing here on the high ground, the fog is a
bit less dense. There is the remains of a large bonfire smouldering in the
middle of the clearing and around the perimeter are stakes with skulls
atop them. There is a strange energy that hangs in the air here that seems
to grow in intensity the longer you are here. You hadn't noticed it before,
but it has increased to an audible buzzing as if you had entered a giant
beehive. One thing is for certain, that whatever this strange force is, it
is not one of good will towards man.

Haven of Chaos~
This is the domain of Lord Chaos, God of Darkness Eternal. The room is
bathed in a strange pink aura that seems to have no source, yet illuminates
the entire room. There is a huge throne at the back of the room that is
made of ebony and covered in some sort of animal hide. In the middle of the
room is a black iron stand that holds a large copper dish containing blood.
The air here is filled with the aroma of burnt flesh and on the floor you
notice the charred skeletal remains of other mortals that have had the
misfortune of entering Lord Chaos's domain.

Dead End~
The passageway ends abruptly at a wall made into a massive wine rack that
contains hundreds of bottles of imported wine. This must be the King's
own private stash of prime wine he saves for special occassions.

There is every shape, size, and color of bottle imaginable stowed away

very tempting to nab some of these bottles for later when you have time
to celebrate, but since your hands are so full all you can get is one.

is the outter defensive wall and far to the north is the Northern outter
defensive wall. There seems to be no sign of life around, but best to be on
your guard, for you never know what kind of creatures might be lurking
nearby. The courtyard continues north and there is a ladder leading up to
the top of the secondary wall.

his fellow man. At one end of the room is a hearth that has burning coals
in it with red hot iron pokers stuck into the coals. There is an open "Iron
Maiden" in the corner, revealing her hideous spikes just awaiting her next
meal. On the rack in the middle of the room is fresh blood where obviously
someone got carried away with stretching the poor soul whose blood now
drips upon the floor.

You are standing inside the entry foyer of Castle Galadorn feeling somewhat
intimidated by the decor of the room. On the floor is a mosaic of a large
eye set into a background of fire. The walls are painted with mythical (You
hope), creatures that could only have originated from hell and they appear
to be watching your every move. To the northeast and northwest
are statues of mythical gargoyles sculpted from black marble.
Towering above the statues of the gargoyles is a statue of a large dragon
carved from black onyx. To the west lies a set of double ebony black doors
and to the east is a smaller ebony door. South is a large black metal
door.

his outstretched head. His massive wings are spread in a posture of attack
and his tail is raised high behind him. His mouth is open showing an
impressive set of huge razor sharp teeth and his tongue is extended out
of it as well making him seem that much more menacing.

window inset into it flanked on either side by smaller statues of gargoyles.

in so far. The decor of the room is set in colors of white and teal, giving
this room a feeling of warmth and comfort. The four post bed has a soft
feather mattress and is covered with a teal and rust colored comforter.
The floor lamps which burn in this chamber oddly enough cast an actual
white light as opposed to the pinkish aura of the torches out in the hall.
By the light of the floor lamps you notice a small elegant dressing table
with perfumes and makeup neatly arranged on it's surface. In one corner
of the room stands an oval full length mirror set into Mastadon tusks that
stand on end. There is a door to the west.

lavishly furnished. There is a large black canopy bed draped with a thick
black comforter with two large black satin pillows at the head of the bed.
Upon either side of the bed are matching tables with black lamps sitting
atop them. Along the north wall is a black dressing table with a rectangular
mirror sitting atop it and neatly arranged potions, makeups, and jewlery.
In one corner of the room stands an armoir that matches the other furniture

sitting upon a throne of fire.

Unexplainably this room has a most evil aura about that is stronger than
anything you have ever felt. The very air you breathe even tastes of raw
pure evil. There are satanic markings that have been engraved into the
polished black floor with care and diligence. The room is circular in shape
and standing around the room are statues of evil hellhounds. The sacrificial
altar that sits in the middle of the room is also constructed of shiny black
marble and at one end of it is a golden basin for collecting the blood of
those sacrificed. As you look around there appears to be no exits.

Looking somewhat like a cross between a bat and a human with a long

Priests Quarters~
This finely decorated room is the head priests quarters. It is very well lit
by ceiling lamps that emit the same eerie light as the torches you have seen.
There is a king size bed with matching nightstands to either side with
lamps upon each of them. There is a big black fur used as a rug on the
floor that came from some huge unknown beast. At one end of the room
sits a small idol bearing the likeness of Lord Chaos. In one corner sits a
small writing desk that is littered with notes pertaining to the next sermon.
There is a door to the west.

As large as this rug is the animal whose hide this came from must have
been enormous. With the thick wooly texture of it, the beast must have
come from some region of immense cold.

Harpy Pit~
You have fallen into one of the Priest's traps he has set for intruders

Bavmorta's Trap~
You have been thrown into a pit from which there is no apparent
escape. Maybe with some time and patience you will find a way out. The
one thing you can't do is give up hope. Just be thankful this isn't a Death

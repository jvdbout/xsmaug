maniacal prisoner~
a maniacal prisoner~
A maniacal prisoner giggles insanely at you.

turnkey~
a drunken turnkey~
The turnkey snores loudly as he sleeps off another binge.
~
His job bores him to tears. No one ever tries to escape. His duties are
limited to escorting prisoners to and from their cells, and occasionally
beating a noisy or frightened prisoner into submission. So he spends most
(heck, ALL) of his time drinking.

inquisitor~
the inquisitor~
The inquisitor stands here, extracting "confessions".
~
He seems somewhat puzzled by your presence, then shrugs and turns back to
his task. The world is full of sickos, and if you get your jollies watching
a man being tortured to death, well... that's how he gets his, too.

master torturer~
the master torturer~
The master torturer grins wickedly and gives the rack another turn.
~
This gap-toothed moron is quite adept at causing hapless prisoners exquisite
pain without any grave danger to their lives. And, what's more, he enjoys it!
Job satisfaction is SO important, really. I mean, if you don't enjoy your
job, what have you got?

a noble prisoner~
A noble prisoner is being kept here.
~
This fellow was imprisoned by the Castellan for offensive behavior towards
the Castellan's daughter during the Castellan's Ball held recently. He is of
high status, however, and thus the Castellan afforded him a decent cell. For
a price, of course.

You have entered the quarters of the dungeon guards. There are usually a few
off duty guards here at any given time, playing cards, dice, etc. to while
away the time before their next shift.  A door to the west is marked- DOGS!
KEEP OUT!

A trapdoor leads upward to the city square, where prisoners who are
sentenced to death are led for their execution.

Here the Turnkey stands his post, managing and guarding the keys to all the

sod, and not much use at either task.

A door to the west leads to Cell Block Two. The torture chamber lies south.

This is the most feared place in all the dungeon. Any and all prisoners who
end up here rarely leave in one piece. And even if they do, they are usually
driven quite insane by the weeks of torture. Long chains hanging from the
ceiling suspend dead or dying victims, while fresher ones are currently
being subjected to cruel tortures on the nightmarish devices below.

This hive of subterranean passageways was once a burial chamber. But the

full of magnificent treasures.

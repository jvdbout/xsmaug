whisp~
The Whisp~
The Whisp of a forgotten hero flutters around.
~
An indescript spirit the whisp is so far gone from this
world that it is impossible to say what sex or even race
the original person was. A sad thing wailing for just
one person to remember envying those who got a plaque
on the walls.

The God Karnay~
A glowing figure sits on the throne awaiting.

As far as one can tell from the glow, the man on the throne
looks quite ordinary, even dull.
His smile is friendly enough though. Maybe you should say 'hello'.

The Storm Harpy~
A filthy screeching harpy attacks!!!

Not a pretty sight! The feathers of the creature look
somewhat oily and ungroomed. The face of the chick is

unicorn one-horned~
The Unicorn~
A breath-takingly beautiful one-horned animal stands on the lawn.
~
Majestic is the first word to come into the mind when looking
at the Unicorn. Beautiful would be the second. Soft pure 
white coat that almost gloams like the full moon, dark 
liquid eyes like pools in a forest and the golden horn
that crowns the head of the creature rend a magical air
to the magnificent creature.
Beautiful and deadly, yet perhaps not unfriendly...

A Cavern in the Mound~
The spacious cavern is empty, save for shelves lining the walls.Urns of various

number in over a thousand. In the middle of the room a sepulchre of an armoured

notice~
The named characters and the plot of this area are based on the
works of Marty Pelletier. I would like to thank Zaknafein, the
creator of the area Darkhaven Art Gallery for the giving much joy
to players all over. In one of the rooms of this area is a statue
that resembles the famous Phunbaba, but only resembles. The picnic
of the ghouls was also inspired by my visit to the famous Art Gallery.
 
Further, I would like to credit the creators of the smaug codebase.
Not only has it made possible for me to create this area, but also
offered certain embellishments to it. The names of them can be seen
by typing 'help greeting'.
 
and now to the tips ...
 
Look around carefully. Running too fast may cause you to pass by
a vital clue, and often there is no return.
 
This area is not meant to be easy. A lot is done by programs and
a great portion of it is nosuplicate and almost all norecall.
 
And one more thing. I hope you can experience the same emotions
I did when writing this. Be angry, frustrated or giggle at my silly
ideas, but most of all, have fun!

Chamber of the Remembered~
This chamber is vast. The ceiling arches so high above you can not even see it 
from here. There are splinters of wooden ladder on the ground, so ancient that 
they have fallen apart on their own. The stone slate that granted you entry has 
closed again, and is too heavy to push open without firm ground under the feet. 
>From the center of the chamber you can barely see the walls even with a light on.

rather mystical. In the center of the chamber a beautiful throne carved of bone 
and redwood stands on a pedestal. In spite of the feeling of antiquity in the 
room it is spotlessly clean and clearly inhabited. This is no tomb, but a throne

take the breath away. The soft blue hue of the sky in perpetual twilight, stars 
just coming out for the the first time, a sea of clouds streching as far as they eye can
see. How high up must this place to be, and how steep is the rockface. No-one 
can climb down there, it takes ability to fly to continue from here.

The cloud rises above. Only thick white fog that makes up the clouds can be 
seen. It swirls and heaves like it were alive. The mist seems to thin to the 
South and the East.

A Darkening Cloud~
The Cloud turns gray here, a change to the everpresent whiteness. The mist turns
into heavy fog and a few little droplets condense and fall down. There seems to 
be more rain ahead to the East and brighter skyes to the North.

but some of them are not what they seem. Flytraps bask in the sun while melting 
their latest catch. Roses have thorns as long as fingernails and a scent straight
from heavens. A clear fountain springs happily out of the mouth of a sculpture
that greatly resembles the famous Phunbaba. Tracks of hooves circle the fountain
and a rose lies crushed on one of the marks.

The Hall of Harnon~
The central hall of the house is impressive in its size. Decorated with taste, 
but with noticably less valuable objects than the private quarters it serves as
the gathering place for the whole clan. Warm fire crackles in the semi-circular 
fireplace in the far corner next to the High Table. The tables of the squires 
line the  walls left and right of the High Table and the rest of the household 
has seats on long tables close to the entrance. The door to the kitchens is to 
the North and the Oaken doors to the West lead out of the Keep.

The walls are draped with tapestries depicting famous battles won by the clan 
Harnon. From the ceiling hang the banners of vanguished foes and their shields 
are nailed on the redwood logs that support the ceiling. None can compete with 
the Harnons in riches and fame except perhaps the Dergnay.

Harnon Garden~
The Garden is every bit as beautiful as rumours have it, but having been shoved
out in such a patronizing manner is no fun. The scents and the sounds of the 
Garden soon sooth your ruffled feathers. Sun is shining, flowers bloom, birds 
sing, the peaches are almost ripe and ready for plocking. It is a glorious 
Summer day.

damp room. No, not a room, a cell carved in the Mound. The pile of straw you 
woke up on is relatively clean, only  a few roaches and a big Kuirgah spider 
scurry about. On the little shelf  below the peephole in the door a dented mug 
and a cracked bowl have atracted a little mouse. The only light comes from the

The floor is covered with graystone slates and is surprisingly
clean. But then the City always prided itself for 'taking care of

Domain of Delusions~
All is clouded in a disorienting haze. Nothing looks the same very
long, everything shifts and changes. Very little is real in this
domain, but no less dangerous.

Heavenly Light~
A golden light surronds everything. As far as the eye can see everything
is bathed in soft warm glow. Marble columns support an ornate roof, yet 
something gives the impression that it does not rain here often and never
without permission. Flowers bloom on vines encircling the support pillars. 
The air smells of flowers and spice and of something indefinable. It seems 
like the air is thicker than elsewhere, more invigorating and satisfying. 
Those who reside here need no other sustenance. The Air is enough.

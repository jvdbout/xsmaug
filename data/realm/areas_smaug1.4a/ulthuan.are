eternal flame, through which the chosen candidate for Phoenix King must
walk in order to receive the blessing of Asuryan. In battle the Phoenix
Guard fight with their ceremonial halberds, clad in cloaks of embroidered

the dragons incinerating those that escaped the lances of their masters.
Now those days are gone, and the great beasts can only rarely be roused
from their slumber. Instead, the Dragon Princes carry on their ancient
martial tradition, fighting on the backs of Elven steeds instead of great
wyrms.

The Chimera looks like it has been made up from leftover pieces of other
creatures. They are huge creatures with three heads ad a vicious lashing
tail which is barbed with venomous stings. Each of their heads is different:
one breathes fire and is scaled like a dragon, the second is that of a great
lion, and the last carries the curling horns of a ram.

The cockatrice looks rather like a gigantic and somewhat ragged cockerel.
Its body is covered with a haphazard mix of scales and feathers whilst
its wings are leathery and bat-like. The head that sits atop this bizarre
combination is a grotesque caricature of a proud bantam, with brilliant
blood-red wattles and a fearsomely shark beak.

A Giant Scorpion raises his poisonous tail and points it at you.
~
Giant Scorpions are somewhat of a law to themselves, but through much patience
a few specially training some High Elves have managed to control them just
enough for them to be a useful form of attack. The Giant Scorpion itself is
covered in a hard, jet-black skin, which acts as its armour. At the tip of
its long tail, you can see a sharp needle-like spine. This is naturally used
as its main weapon.

A Giant Spider~
As a Giant Spider crawls towards you, all you can really see are its long, hairy legs.
~
Giant Spiders were originally found deep in the Lustria by lizardmen many
years ago. They have now ventured out a little further into the main land
and found refuge in Plains along with their co-habitors, the Giant Scorpions.
The Gigantic Spider itself is black in colour with millions of tiny hairs
protruding from its skin. As you look closer, you can see it has a set of
small, razor-sharp teeth.

A Harpy~
A Harpy flaps its wings and lifts off the ground slightly.

For the High Elves, the Harpies are an evil portent, a sign of the darkest
of fortune. They are beloved of the Druchii and the sound of their leathery
wings thrashing the air is often the first sign of attack.

A Wyvern stretches its scaled wings out and gives them a small flap.
~
Wyverns are sometimes known as 'mere-Dragons', because they resemble those
mighty creatures. However, they is nothing 'mere' about the fighting ability
of these huge scaled beasts. Their vast slavering jaws are easily able to
bite a High Elf in half, or swallow him whole should they choose.

A Griffon opens its large mouth and exhales a ball of fire.
~
Griffons are noble beasts, as beasts go, though they are far from
tame and placid. Their heads are like that of a huge bird of prey,
whilst their bodies resemble that of a lion or other great cat. All
this is borne aloft by a large pair of wings that carries the Griffon
across the high mountains where it dwells.

The majority of warriors in the High Elf armies are citizen militia rather
than professional soldiers. This militia is a form of part-time army in
which all take their turn to serve, every High Elf providing his own
battle gear in defence of his home and country. The spearman makes up
much of the core of the High Elf army.

Some Deep Green Hills~
The hills begin to shallow out at this point and just to your east
and to the south, you can see many trees and areas of dense forest.
A small stone wall marks out a boundary and leads eastwards down from
the hillside along a path, with a similar wall leading southwards.

area of forest and eastwards towards the Shadowlands of Nagarythe. The
Shadowlands of Nagarythe are a small, protected area of woodland, owned
by the High Elves of Ulthuan. Only a true seasoned adventurer would dare
stray into such an area without asking the Phoenix King's permission
first.

The Shadowlands of Nagarythe~
The Shadowlands of Nagarythe are a wooded area that lies to the south of
the city of Ulthuan, protected by a secret order of High Elves that roam
the surrounding area. The ground consists mainly of grass, upon which are
scattered many loose stones and small rocks. Tall green trees stand high
from amongst nearby gatherings of granite rocks.

The wooded area of the Shadowlands of Nagarythe would make it easy for
marauding thieves and bandits to hide and lay in wait for the unsuspecting
traveller. This makes you feel very uneasy especially as a few yards in

many fields which lead towards a range of small hills far into the
distance. Cattle graze on some of the fields, presumably easting the
lush green grass that grows near to them.

A Pathway to Ulthuan~
The pathway continues in a southerly and westerly direction. On either
side of the path you can see several rows of trees that block your
view into the distance. However the occasional gust of wind parts
some of the tree branches momentarily offering you a chance to see
the ranges of fields that lie beyond the tree line.

The pathway appears to be a little darker in this section due to the
fact that many of the trees that line either side of the path encroach
on each other, almost forming some type of wild and natural tunnel.
Clumps of knee-high grasses grow along the path side, covering the
bases of many of the trees' trunks.

who enters and leaves. A small forest of trees lies a little way to the
southwest. Light filters through the some of the trees onto the forest
floor, giving the forest a sense of peace and warmth. Directly to the

walking this path. A strange thing seems to be happening around here. You
can see some High Elves bending down, muttering to themselves and then
disappearing from sight. As you draw nearer to them, you believe they are
muttering the name of the mystical creature that the High Elves respect
so much.

The Shrine to Asuryan~
This is the northwest corner of the Shrine to Asuryan, a place where
many clerics work and pray. The well curved pillars and decorated
walls imply that shrine is very important to the High Elves. Rumour
tells that High Elf disciples are still waiting here for the Ancient
Ones to return.

The Shrine to Asuryan~
This section of the shrine is dedicated to "discipline". It is so
important to High Elves to have discipline because they believe that
through rules and principles they will conquer and survive any ordeal.
This area is their major source of power, order and morality.

The Shrine to Asuryan~
Numerous lit candles illuminate every square inches of this room.
The different natural elements from fire, water, wind and east try
to form an order here. The increasing of the water element causes a rain,
a river, a lake or an ocean to form. An excess of the fire elements
ignites wood, melts the metal, vaporizes the water and burn the earth
to ashes. The earth elements bury the water, put out the fire, rust the
metal and make the wood decay. The wind element blows out the fire,
moves the east and causes storms within the waters of Ulthuan. This is
why all of the elements need a place to form order and hence do not
produce chaos.

Standing in this section of the ancient shrine, you notice that
the walls are decorated in a collection of black jade stones. You
feel a great warm radiating from the black jade stones. The black
jades were mined from the deepest volcano from fire plane, far to
the west of Azon'rah. The chamber itself is light by rows of very
bright lamps. It would seem that this section of the shrine is
used to promote a balance between darkness and light. A small exit

that at certain times within the day, the natural light from either the
sun or the moon would beam down through the hole and directly onto the
floor markings. A small exit southwards leads away from this sacred area.

The dark blue sea shifts from left to right as waves pass along the
sea top. Brought along with the waves, clumps of seaweed and driftwood
find their way bobbing towards to shore. The water seems to lead in all
directions.

Out at Sea~
The surface of the sea appears to be a little more placid here than in
other parts. However, upon closer inspection, perhaps the sea is not
quite as safe as you originally thought. Cutting through the waves,
you can see a large grey fin.

The sea seems to be quite rough at this point, as large waves rear
their heads heading for the land. A large lump of seaweed floats by.
The seaweed looks to be about two feet in length and is covered in
loads of small bubbles. You poke the seaweed with your finger and
nothing happens.

You walk in through the doorway to the sounds of metal on metal. Before
you is a huge furnace where an elven weaponsmith is heating up metal.
In front of him is a large anvil. He turns around quickly and knocks
some hot metal into the shape of a large iron longsword. After a couple
of minutes of bashing with his hammer he drops it into a large barrel of
water. Steam rises from the barrel as the hot iron cools. You look around
the room where there seems to be a lot of weapons stacked up against the
walls of the room. You notice spears, knives and swords all made of iron
piled in one corner. On the far wall behind the weaponsmith you notice a
large sword which has been carefully forged. It is encased in a wooden
cabinet which you think is probably locked.

grey fish with whiskers. She pays with some sort of money that you are

already several elven citizens in there forming a queue with their
coins ready to buy their fish.

You wander on further through market down wondering if this road
actually leads anyway in particular. To the north and east, you see
two shops, one a butchers the other a general store. The two smells
intermingle in the air giving an entirely different type of smell
all together.

It was original used by market traders to transport goods from the
waterways to the north to the city of Ulthuan, but in recent years,
the High Elves have tried to become more self-sufficient and now they
grow their own food and manufacture their goods themselves.

The road before you leads southwards towards the Mage's Academy of

wizards, illusionists, mystics and sorcerers in the surrounding area.
The road is paved in a pale yellow stone but the actual road surface
is a little uneven. This could be due to the fact that many of the
High Elves that travel this section of road float along rather than
walk.

Water trickles around the statues feet and down into a pool that must

barrels with water using small buckets. There is a lot of water all over
the floor and small footprints leading away back down the roads that

from any opposition forces. It shows no signs of damage, on this side
at least, so perhaps it was never needed to fulfil that purpose. It
has a large, complicated locking mechanism, which even the most

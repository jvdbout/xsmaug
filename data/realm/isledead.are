Desc     Finding a gap in the reef that surrounds the isle is difficult but not
impossible; presently you are able to negotiate through a small inlet,
and enter the shallow waters that lie between the sandy shores of the
jungle-covered island and the reef. A large smoking volcano soars up
from the center of the isle, spewing black smoke and ash. Most of it
does not land on the island, and is instead carried far out to sea. A
definite sense of foreboding is gripping you, as you near the isle, as
if something were horribly wrong.

Desc     You cruise along the coast, searching for an appropriate place to set
ashore. As you do, your mind wanders, and you recall the many rumors
spoken in hushed whispers in taverns from Freeport to Irilian, of the
dark and mysterious Island of the Dead, where strange magicks cast by
dark priests have transformed a peaceful isle of natives to a haven
of zombies, who aid the priests in gaining new victims for their dark
rituals. Previously you had dismissed such rumors as irrational and
superstitious, but as you approach this volcanic island, you begin to
harbor doubts.

enough they don't appear to have noticed your arrival. In fact, they
don't appear to be noticing much of anything. Plumes of smoke obscure
your vision upwards, rising from the volcano to the north. Something 
is definitely amiss here; despite the crystal clear waters and all the
lush green vegetation, you feel as if you are approaching a graveyard.

beads on your brow as you stride up onto the beach. A series of white
skulls, bleached by the sun, sit on wooden posts to either side, as
a grim warning of some sort. You had heard that the natives of these
waters were friendly; evidently this particular group doesn't appear 
to fall under that classification. Shrieking birds of prey circle far
overhead, as if expecting an imminent feast. The shore stretches far 
to the east and west, circling the small island.

left behind as if after the feast of some animal capable of rending 
and crushing a soul's body to pulp. Natives can be seen to either side
though they for the most part ignore you. Despite the vacant stares of
the natives, they are not silent; strange mumblings and the sound of
jungle drums can be heard all around. The effect is disconcerting, to
say the least.

Desc     Plunging into the jungle, you have to constantly pause to swat at the
hordes of stinging, biting insects that swarm about you, disturbed
and subsequently excited by your unexpected arrival. Evidently those
native to this island provide little blood, for they seem incredibly
eager to feed on yours. Stumbling northward, you suddenly spot a hut
of wood to the east, its door closed, and overgrown with weeds, which
also cover the single window. The ground underfoot is soggy, and you
notice with a slight degree of alarm that you have sunk ankle deep in
the marshy ground.

or exploration, or perhaps something else? At any rate, most of the
bodies bear horrid bite marks, wounds inflicted by ravenous carnivore
in a fit of bloodlust. Someone dragged them here, then neglected to
bury them, hence the stench. Gagging, you attempt to see what else is
in this death pit, noticing only a single bed has escaped the damage.

only barely seem to register your presence. Far to the northeast, a
short distance out to sea, you think you can see the broken hull of
a ship, wrecked on the reef you found so difficult to negotiate. This
vessel does not bear imperial markings, at least none visible from this

they attempted to reach (or escape) this volcanic isle.

Desc     The first realization you have upon entering this room is relief that
the veil clouding both your magic and your vocal chords appears to 
have lifted. Unfortunately, this revelation came about as you shrieked
and prepared your magical defenses upon spying the horrid, twisted
occupant of this dark chamber.

Name     Climbing the Tree~
Sector   forest~
Desc     Clambering up the thick vine, you are instantly aware of several pairs
of eyes watching you, from the dense, impenetrable foliage. A high
pitched chattering begins nearby; a monkey, perhaps, or one of those
indigenous to this place communicating with his or her fellows? At any
rate, you are certain that this vine has been placed here by design 
rather than accident, and that it leads to the lair of some of those
same indigenous peoples.

Name     Assault from Above~
Sector   forest~
Desc     Nearing the top of the vine, you can make out a wooden platform, that
was not visible from even five feet away, so well-camoflagued it is.
A soft hooting noise, not unlike the owls of your homeland, starts up
now, and you are certain that your progress is being carefully watched,
even prepared for. Feeling increasingly vulnerable hanging from this
vine, you hasten your ascent.

Name     A Wooden Platform~
Sector   inside~
Flags    indoors~
Desc     The vine terminates at a wooden platform, upon which rest several beds
of moss. A small wooden table, crudely made, bears an earthenware
bowl loaded with berries, an obvious sign of sentient, albeit rather
primitive, habitation. The air is humid, and uncomfortably warm, as
you would expect in this jungle-covered isle.
The platform continues all around, a confusing maze of twisting rope
bridges and tangled vines. Creatures scurry about on all sides of you,
some venturing forth to make contact. The sole possessions you spy
are rude and barely functional; it doesn't appear that you will have
the opportunity to loot much here.

Desc     You find yourself in a highly undesirable position. Hovering only a
hair-singeing short distance above the maw of the volcano, you can
even here feel the heat rapidly dehydrating you and scalding your
skin. Every metal object in your possession begins to glow as it is
heated, and blisters form on your skin. A howling, shrieking wind
gusts up out of the fiery mountain, assaulting you at sporadic and
untimely intervals. To fall here would mean a horrible death, beyond
redemption.

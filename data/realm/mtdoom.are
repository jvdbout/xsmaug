Desc      Krothgar, standing at over eight feet tall and clad in full spiked black
plate mail, is an imposing... man. It is said his fists have the power to
rend the very earth asunder if he is angered. It is small wonder the dark
powers have chosen him as their fell agent on Anon.

crush him (and definitely them) with little effort. Krothgar tolerates their
presence in honor of the alliance he has forged with the dark powers to
facilitate the conquest of Anon.

Krothgar performs. This does not mean that he will fail to defend himself
to the best of his considerable abilities if the need arises.

Desc      You are heading directly toward Mount Doom, on a narrow path that leads to
the desolate, monster-infested plains that surround it. This is the fell
domain of Lord Krothgar, whose forbidding black fortress can be seen atop the
peak of the extinct volcano called by humans Mount Doom. Armies of giants
patrol the lower slopes, while evil mutants, mages and demons guard the
fortress itself. Steeling yourself, you push on.

Desc      You have come to the base of the mountain. From here you may continue to
slowly make your way up the mountain, or head back to the eerie plains below.
The ground here is rocky and treacherous, dotted by small crevices in the
volcanic rock and jagged shards of granite protrustions. The wind is even
stronger here than on the plains, and you fancy you can hear voices and
screams.

ExDesc       Nairod and Nalliw

Much has happend in my life since we fought side by side in the troll war.
I hope, sometime, to have a chance to talk with you about the many pleasant
things.

My purpose now,sadly, is to ask my corageous comrades to aid my people in a
time of dire need. I cannot even describe to you the danger that threatens
Enalro, for I know not its true nature. I do know that unless it can be
stopped, this evil will consume my village and its families. We will vanish
without trace into the dust of history.

A sinister force is at work here, and it is made the more frightening by
the fact that its true nature is concealed in a web of fear and suspicion.
I plead with you, come to Enalro, lend your skills to revealing this menace,
that it may finally be destroyed.

                                   Your comrade,
                                   Zachius Ormo

shrubbery. The bushes between the trees are dense, rising to a height of
eight or ten feet. The elms themselves average about 75 feet tall, and they
are the only trees here. They are widely spaced, allowing much sunlight to
pour between their ancient boughs.

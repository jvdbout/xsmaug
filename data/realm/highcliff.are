reads:
 
Baalzebul's Skull:
 
     In fact there were several skulls made by cult of Baalzebul.  The
process in which the skulls were made is unknown, but the powers have
been well documented.  Each skull has a number of healing spells cast
upon them, much like a staff or orb.  However to activate the magical
powers one must hold the item, causing the user to be teleported to a
random location.  The charges are limited and when completely used, it
explodes sending shards of crystal everywhere.  Caution should be used
when handling one of these skulls.
 
Note: Users have complained of a physical and mental burden while they
are carring this object.  Most users either are never heard from again
or are maimed in the skulls explosion.
 
History of the Skulls:

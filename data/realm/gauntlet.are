actions of the Ogrillon were any indication, then these gems must be 
crushed, in the appropriate chamber of release. There is a list of those

Keep is smaller than you expected, set in the side of a mountain and

The southern path runs towards a large, iron bound door, set in the high
stone wall, which is undoubtedly under observation from the crenelated

Desc      The short path ends before a small gateway. Long shadows are cast across
the path by the Keep's towers. The walls around the gate are dotted with
crossletted arrowslits, from which dozens of guards could easily pepper
whoever approached with arrows and other missiles. Larger openings, for
the pouring of boiling oil, also gape near the entrance, and it is from
these that you receive a sudden gout of that horrid weapon of siege warfare.
The boiling oil is quickly followed by several volleys of arrows, pincushioning
your screaming, burning form, and you shriek and shudder quite spectacularly
before expiring.

Desc      This path swiftly descends along the side of the mountain that holds the
Keep, heading towards whatever lies at the base (hopefully another, more
approachable, entrance). Heading down here means passing out of view of
the towers, which is also good. The path shows signs of significant usage
in times past, by heavy wagons laden with cargo. No such vehicle has passed
this way in recent times, however; with the protection of the Keep and its
garrison gone, the route is considered too perilous.

Desc      Thick scrub grows along the path where it descends steeply, eventually
levelling out at the lowest level of the Keep, the walls of which lie 
to the southwest, partially barring the trail. By sticking close to
the mountain side of the trail, you can remain hidden from any observers
on the battlements, and approach the lower level unnoticed. If gnolls do
indeed now occupy this place, then you can expect their security to be
more lax than it should be.

buttressed section of the battlements, which contains a heavy gate, 
studded with iron and firmly barred by both physical and magical forces.
Impervious to mundane means of entrance, it can only be broached by those
who bear the Sentinel, the artifact created to help defend this place.
The Sentinel failed, however, not being present during the conquest of
this place due to the lax actions of its wearer, the last Duke of Alderweg.
Now, perhaps, it may be given a chance to help in the recapture of this
once-hallowed outpost.

Desc      This is, strategically speaking, one of the most important chambers in
the Keep, for it is from here that guards can look out for intruders
advancing along the upper path that you had the choice of taking earlier.
It is apparent now that to follow that path would have been sheer suicide,
for alert guards armed with bows await such an approach, and would be able
to cut down a score of armored footmen before the unfortunate soldiers
knew what hit them. The door bears numerous bars and locks, far too heavy
for even 2 or 3 sturdy adventurers to budge; this gate is not a good choice
to enter or exit the keep by. However, there are other alternatives.
 
A second door, of more conventional proportions and thickness, bars an exit

chamber, accompanied by alcohol and blood stains, the inevitable result of
countless hours of carousing. Crossletted arrowslits allow a limited view
of the surrounding terrain; certainly an astute and skilful archer could
pick off many dozens of foes from such a vantage point. A series of murder
holes set in the floor enable defenders to pour cauldrons of boiling oil
on any who manage to breach the battlements and approach from this direction.

is at a premium in the small keep, however, and the lack of amenities

however; they prefer their meat fresh and raw. Thus the chamber has

Desc      The chambers of the Castellan are but a former shade of their once-
impressive condition. Fine tapestries depicting Alderweg have been torn
to ribbons, and lie piled on the floor. Antique furniture lies smashed
to smithereens, near pools of dried blood. Torn cloth and broken weapons
fill the corners, as do numerous corpses in various stages of decay. The
smell is awful, but the horrid, lurking dread caused only by the presence
of something truly evil is far, far worse.

Desc      The windows of this turret have been boarded up for some unknown reason,
thus eliminating the majestic view. Weapons and armor of all sorts, mostly
far inferior to your own, have been stockpiled here, including recently
added longbows of gnollish manufacture; crude, but powerful weapons. A
skeleton lies in one corner, slumped over a weapon rack, apparently much
older than the duration of the gnollish occupation. Yet who was its slayer,
and why did the previous garrison not remove it...?

restrictions. The remains of Gannaway are visible far to the northwest,
while beyond that the Lewyn flows from Lake Spendlowe, upon which rests
the village of Kusnir, the hamlet where you first began this quest. To

the cramped conditions and the uncomfortable temperature. Fresh air

creatures that construced this passage began their work. The tunnel itself
is an admirable feat, despite the considerable discomfort it causes non-

lay of the land towards the keep has been beyond engineers from intelligent
races seeking to conquer the keep for decades.

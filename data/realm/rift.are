Desc      Like all the giantish races, the frost giants supplant their relatively
small numbers with large volumes of troops of other races, most notably
ogres, trolls and gnolls. These mercenaries serve well as long as they
are paid and fed, and the odds are stacked in their favor. They are not
as powerful as giants, but are still very tough and strong.

snow-covered spires loom all around, while gale force winds buffet you
mercilessly. The wind howls and shrieks as it blows through the gaps
between the peaks; the effect is quite disturbing. The only apparent
escape from this torment is a small hole in the ground, that leads on
down into the darkness within the mountain.

Snow drifts formed by snow that has come in the hole above pile high to

of whom are rather large; giantish in fact. The howling wind above is
nerve wracking, and it takes little incentive to proceed downwards to
where it is quieter.

fresh; it appears dozens of giants have been on the move recently.
This is no surprise; you are here because of their 'movements' that

its entire length, though judging by the tracks it is not a popular

Desc      The volume of footprints in the thin layer of snow that carpets this
tunnel, having blown in from the rift to the north, indicates that 
this is a busy thoroughfare, and undoubtedly proceeds to chambers of
some import. Whether that is a good thing or not remains to be seen.
A great deal of noise- bragging, laughing, shouting and swearing- is
audible south of here, its source a brightly lit cavern that appears 
to be filled with giants.

Desc      A series of ledges at various heights in this broad chamber bear piles
of furs and hides, and serve as the bunks for the guards garrisoned in
here. A small campfire sheds illumination through most of the cavern,
the heat enough to keep its occupants a good distance away while their
meal cooks, though generous amounts of alcohol have dulled their innate
fear of fire. The cavern continues to the southeast, where more giants
are stationed.

litter the floor, as do haunches of half-cooked (and half-eaten) meat.

Desc      It would be unfair of you to be upset at the fate you befell, after
ignoring both the warning and the evidence seen by your own two eyes.
Seconds before several large chunks of ice reduce you to a smear, you
wonder if your ancestors were as stupid as you, and if so how did they
survive long enough to breed? Your body will remain here, entombed
beneath hundreds of tons of rubble, never to be seen again.

the important giants, including numerous ambassadors and of course
the Jarl himself. As such, it is constantly manned, the piles of furs

Desc      Once again you find yourself back on one of the many sections of ledge
that circle most of the rift. This ledge is much closer to the raging
blizzard that fills the center of the rift, and thus you find it quite
difficult to maintain your position on the icy ground. Flight more than
a few inches off the ground is both inadvisable and stupid; the fierce
winds would pick you up and dash you against the rock walls. The ledge

gusts of wind, it is not as difficult to keep your footing, though
progress is slow. Another cave opening offers shelter from the storm,
though it is undoubtedly inhabited, as the Jarl keeps most of the many

is life down there, undoubtedly of the unfriendly variety.

rocky, unhewn walls, this cavern is actually a chamber proper; the 
stone has been carefully worked into a series of doric columns, that
support a vaulted roof heavily decorated with art that appears elvish
in origin, though it is unlike any you have ever seen. Evidently this
place was fashioned by creatures centuries older than the giants, and
abandoned some time ago. The floor is of polished marble, its lustre
adding a glorious shine as your light reflects off of it and onto all
the jewelled statues that ring the hall. It continues to the northeast,
the floor raising slightly to match the terrain. A legion of dwarves
would take decades to match this marvel; even stone giants would be left
gasping in awe at the work that went into bending the natural stone to

Desc      The ogres that serve the Jarl as mercenaries and servants are quartered
here, on piles of fur next to which rest small chests for the ogres'
meagre personal possessions. A campfire burns in the center, between 
the bedding, where the ogres prepare their humble meals. The conditions
are poor, but doubtless better than they'd be used to, especially when
most of them are undoubtedly natives of the Kore or the Drachensgrab.

Desc      This small cavern houses a single giant- a cloud giant from the far
away realms of his kind, here to listen to the Jarl's spiel. He has
been convinced that the Jarl has a very good chance of making a tidy
sum of money from his raids, and has signed on as a mercenary. Other
giants, not as easily impressed by the Jarl's speeches, have declined
an alliance, and returned home; many of the cloud giants have stayed
here, and subsequently left in disgust- not all cloud giants are evil.
A table laden with food and fine cutlery are just some of the cajolery
employed by the cunning frost giant lord.

on a table of polished oak, covered with satin cloth. Wall hangings

protect your feet from the cold floor. The Jarl has gone to great pains
to make the occupant of this cell as comfortable as possible, though it
is still a cell, despite its trappings.

virtues of frost giant kind in glorious exaggeration. Torches set in
iron cressets at chest height (to a giant) cast long shadows on the
stone floor, obscuring whatever may lurk in the corners. This cavern
runs due south to the throne of the Jarl himself.

It is apparent that the frost giants have lived and labored in the
caves surrounding the dark rift for centuries, slowly bending the 
rock to suit their needs, until they had carved from the rock this
system of caves to house their people. It would be an admirable feat
were it not achieved by a vile, cruel race using slave labor without
concern for the well being of those so abused.

burning human meat would repulse most races, though giants apparently
relish in human meat, as well as halfling, naturally, which is generally
considered the most succulent meat.

Desc      This spacious chamber is filled with all manner of trophies. The skins
and hides of a score of different creatures cover the walls and floor,
and even the ceiling. Shelves lined with skulls- human, giant, elven,
dwarven, ogre and even gnomish- are placed in front of the hides, while
a fireplace supports a row of mastodon tusks, flanked by the mighty
tusks of an Umber Hulk. The skins of the creatures range from mundane 
(boars, bears, snakes and birds) to the exotic (wyverns, dragons, sabre
tooth tigers and even a shedu). Arms and armor taken from foes from many
parts of the world are also present, each bearing the scars from blows of
the Jarl that were the end of their former owners. A lynx pelt hangs over
an exit in the eastern wall, where presumably the Jarl rests, while a hide
of a giant lizard flanked by a pair of eagle's wings hang above the exit
to the north.

Desc      Those giants who are of higher status in the caverns reside here, near
the quarters of the Jarl himself. They have proper beds, not piles of
hides, and considerable amounts of furnishings, stolen from races they
have raided or conquered. Evidently those quartered here are also of
considerable means.

Desc      In comparison to the Jarl's grisly trophy lounge, this chamber is
strikingly bare. Only a few sparse decorative features are present;
the most notable is a large bear skin, a beloved pet of the Jarl and
his wife, that covers the floor. A large table littered with jacks
of ale and goblets of wine is ample evidence of the tastes these two
have for alcohol, and the fine foods from a dozen different cultures
is a result of the many raids made by the Jarl; he has developed a
taste for foreign cuisine. Several boxes and chests stuffed with a
range of worthless clothing and similar line the walls.

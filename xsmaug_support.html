<p>Having trouble with <strong>XSMAUG</strong>?</p>
First, check out the <strong>Documentation</strong> in the <strong>'doc'</strong> directory or at <strong><a href="https://github.com/smaugmuds/xsmaug/wiki">XSMAUG Wiki</a></strong>, after that, try to report us an <strong><a href="https://github.com/smaugmuds/xsmaug/issues">Issue</a></strong> and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.</p>
<p>We rewrote all of the documentation files for the new <strong>XSMAUG 2.0 Phoenix Release</strong>, and have been keeping them up-to-date since.</p>
<p>Also check the <strong>'wizhelp'</strong>, <strong>'help'</strong> and <strong>'hhelp'</strong> commands and read the <strong>'help'</strong> descriptions for the individual immortal commands. In game Online Help Pages will be more useful and updated.</p>
<p>When you write us, we need to know what kind of machine you're running on.  If you can give us specific information about the problem, that helps too. Specific information means: an <strong>adb</strong> or <strong>gdb</strong> stack trace (if you're reporting a crash), or a <strong>syslog</strong> with the relevant commands logged.  The player files are ascii files, you can dump them into your mail message too.</p>

<h3>Support or Contact</h3>
<p>Having trouble with <strong>XSMAUG</strong>?</p>
First, check out the documentation at <strong><a href="https://github.com/smaugmuds/xmerc/wiki">XSMAUG Wiki</a></strong> or send an Issue and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.</p>
<p>We rewrote all of the documentation files for the <strong>XSMAUG 2.0 Phoenix Release</strong>, and have been keeping them up-to-date since.</p>
<p>Also check the <strong>'wizhelp'</strong> command and read the <strong>'help'</strong> descriptions for the individual immortal commands.</p>
<p>When you write us, we need to know what kind of machine you're running on.  If you can give us specific information about the problem, that helps too.</p>
<p>Specific information means: an adb or gdb stack trace (if you're reporting a crash), or a syslog with the relevant commands logged.  The player files are ascii files -- dump them into your mail message too.</p>
<p>You can also read the Documentation in the <strong>'doc'</strong> directory.</p>

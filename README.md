### Support or Contact

Having trouble with **XMERC**?

First, read the documentation in the 'doc' directory.  We rewrote all of the documentation files from scratch for the 2.0 Alpha release, and have been keeping them up-to-date since.

Also check the 'wizhelp' command and read the 'help' descriptions for the individual immortal commands.

We have a mailing list, at 'merc@kpc.com'.  Send mail to 'merc-request@kpc.com' to join the list.

You can write to us directly at the e-mail addresses at the top of this document.

When you write us, we need to know what kind of machine you're running on.  If you can give us specific information about the problem, that helps too.

Specific information means: an adb or gdb stack trace (if you're reporting a crash), or a syslog with the relevant commands logged.  The player files are ascii files -- dump them into your mail message too.

If your e-mail is too vague, we're likely to bounce it back.  There are three of us and dozens of you -- we simply can't engage in long-distance debugging, on unknown platforms, with the added factor of more code that you've dropped in
since the release.

Check out the documentation at **[XMERC Wiki] (https://github.com/smaugmuds/xmerc/wiki)** or send an Issue and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.

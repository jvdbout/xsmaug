**Ne[X]t Generation of [S]imulated [M]edieval [A]dventure Multi-[U]ser [G]ame**

**XSMAUG** is a multiplayer text-based role-playing game, which is a type of MUD. It can be used and modified to create your own game server.

**XSMAUG** is an enhancenment of **AFKMud 2.1.5**, the goal is to develop a new structure to build and run in modern distributed system environments. **AFKMud**, is an fixed **SMAUG 1.4a** which is a heavily modified derivative of the **Merc 2.1** distribution. Stock area zones from **SMAUG 1.4a** have been restored into **XSMAUG**.

**SMAUG 1.4a** is close to six times the size of **Merc 2.1**, and has major changes to the inner workings of the code, hence making porting of code from other Diku-derivatives non-trivial to the non-coder. Due to the ability to edit most everything online, you will most likely find the online help pages more informative. **SMAUG** is the base code that runs the popular **Realms of Despair** MUD. Through the years it has been tweaked, modified, and enhanced to become one of the most feature packed branches of the **MERC** family of codebases. 

**SMAUG** is a derivative of **Merc Diku Mud** is a **Diku Mud** with many enhancements and contributions. It was written in 1990 and 1991 by **Sebastian Hammer**, **Tom Madsen**, **Katja Nyboe**, **Michael Seifert**, and **Hans Henrik Stærfeldt** at **DIKU** _(Datalogisk Institut Københavns Universitet)—the department of computer science at the University of Copenhagen in Copenhagen, Denmark_. Commonly referred to as simply **"Diku"**, the game was greatly inspired by **AberMUD**, though **Diku** became one of the first multi-usergames to become popular as a freely-available program for its gameplay and similarity to **Dungeons & Dragons**.

**AberMUD** was the first popular open source MUD. It was named after the town _Aberystwyth_, in which it was written. The first version was written in **B** by **Alan Cox**, **Richard Acott**, **Jim Finnis**,and **Leon Thrane** based at **University of Wales**, _Aberystwyth_ for an old **Honeywell** mainframe and opened in 1987.

### Support or Contact

Having trouble with **XSMAUG**?

First, check out the documentation at **[XSMAUG Wiki] (https://github.com/smaugmuds/xmerc/wiki)** or send an Issue and we’ll help you sort it out.

We rewrote all of the documentation files for the **XSMAUG 2.0 Phoenix Release**, and have been keeping them up-to-date since.

Also check the **'wizhelp'**, **'help'**, **'hlist'** commands and read the **'help'** descriptions for the individual immortal commands.

When you write us, we need to know what kind of machine you're running on.  If you can give us specific information about the problem, that helps too.

Specific information means: an adb or gdb stack trace (if you're reporting a crash), or a syslog with the relevant commands logged.  The player files are ascii files -- dump them into your mail message too.

You can also read the Documentation in the **'doc'** directory.

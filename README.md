### Support or Contact

Having trouble with **XMERC**?

First, read the documentation in the 'doc' directory.  We rewrote all of the documentation files from scratch for the 2.0 Alpha release, and have been keeping them up-to-date since.

Also check the 'wizhelp' command and read the 'help' descriptions for the individual immortal commands.

When you write us, we need to know what kind of machine you're running on.  If you can give us specific information about the problem, that helps too.

Specific information means: an adb or gdb stack trace (if you're reporting a crash), or a syslog with the relevant commands logged.  The player files are ascii files -- dump them into your mail message too.

Check out the documentation at **[XMERC Wiki] (https://github.com/smaugmuds/xmerc/wiki)** or send an Issue and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.

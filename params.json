We rewrote all of the documentation files from scratch for the 2.0 Alpha release, and have been keeping them up-to-date since.\r\n\r\nAlso check the 'wizhelp' command and read the 'help' descriptions for the individual immortal commands.\r\n\r\nWe have a mailing list, at 'merc@kpc.com'.  Send mail to 'merc-request@kpc.com' to join the list.\r\n\r\nYou can write to us directly at the e-mail addresses at the top of this document.\r\n\r\nWhen you write us, we need to know what kind of machine you're running on.  If you can give us specific information about the problem, that helps too.\r\n\r\nSpecific information means: an adb or gdb stack trace (if you're reporting a crash), or a syslog with the relevant commands logged.  The player files are ascii files -- dump them into your mail message too.\r\n\r\nIf your e-mail is too vague, we're likely to bounce it back.  There are three of us and dozens of you -- we simply can't engage in long-distance debugging, on unknown platforms, with the added factor of more code that you've dropped in\r\nsince the release.\r\n\r\nCheck out the documentation at **[XMERC Wiki] (https://github.com/smaugmuds/xmerc/wiki)** or send an Issue and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Copyright and License\r\n\r\nDiku Mud is copyright (C) 1990, 1991 by Sebastian Hammer, Michael Seifert, Hans Henrik St{rfeldt, Tom Madsen, and Katja Nyboe.

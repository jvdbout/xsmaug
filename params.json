We rewrote all of the documentation files from scratch for the 2.0 Alpha release, and have been keeping them up-to-date since.\r\n\r\nAlso check the 'wizhelp' command and read the 'help' descriptions for the individual immortal commands.\r\n\r\nWhen you write us, we need to know what kind of machine you're running on.  If you can give us specific information about the problem, that helps too.\r\n\r\nSpecific information means: an adb or gdb stack trace (if you're reporting a crash), or a syslog with the relevant commands logged.  The player files are ascii files -- dump them into your mail message too.\r\n\r\nCheck out the documentation at **[XMERC Wiki] (https://github.com/smaugmuds/xmerc/wiki)** or send an Issue and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Copyright and License\r\n\r\n**Diku Mud** is copyright (C) 1990, 1991 by Sebastian Hammer, Michael Seifert, Hans Henrik St{rfeldt, Tom Madsen, and Katja Nyboe.

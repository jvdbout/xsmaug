<a name="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h3>

<p><strong>Ne[X]t Generation of [S]imulated [M]edieval [A]dventure Multi-[U]ser [G]ame</strong></p>

<p><strong>XSMAUG</strong> is an enhancenment of <strong>SMAUGFuss 1.9</strong>, the goal is to develop a new structure to build and run in modern distributed system environments.</p>

<p><strong>SMAUGFuss 1.9</strong>, an fixed <strong>SMAUG 1.4a</strong> which is a heavily modified derivative of the <strong>Merc 2.1</strong> distribution.</p>

<p><strong>SMAUG 1.4a</strong> is close to six times the size of <strong>Merc 2.1</strong>, and has major changes to the inner workings of the code, hence making porting of code from other Diku-derivatives non-trivial to the non-coder.</p>

<p>Due to the ability to edit most everything online, you will most likely find the online help pages more informative.</p>

<p><strong>SMAUG</strong> is the base code that runs the popular <strong>Realms of Despair</strong> MUD. Through the years it has been tweaked, modified, and enhanced to become one of the most feature packed branches of the <strong>MERC</strong> family of codebases.</p>

<p><strong>SMAUG</strong> is a derivative of <strong>Merc Diku Mud</strong> is a <strong>Diku Mud</strong> with many enhancements and contributions.</p>

<p>Having trouble with <strong>XSMAUG</strong>?</p>

<p>First, check out the documentation at <strong><a href="https://github.com/smaugmuds/xmerc/wiki">XSMAUG Wiki</a></strong> or send an Issue and we’ll help you sort it out.</p>

<p>We rewrote all of the documentation files for the <strong>XSMAUG 2.0 Phoenix Release</strong>, and have been keeping them up-to-date since.</p>

<p>Also check the <strong>'wizhelp'</strong> command and read the <strong>'help'</strong> descriptions for the individual immortal commands.</p>

<p>When you write us, we need to know what kind of machine you're running on.  If you can give us specific information about the problem, that helps too.</p>

<p>Specific information means: an adb or gdb stack trace (if you're reporting a crash), or a syslog with the relevant commands logged.  The player files are ascii files -- dump them into your mail message too.</p>

<p>You can also read the Documentation in the <strong>'doc'</strong> directory.</p>

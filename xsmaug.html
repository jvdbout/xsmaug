<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><strong>XSMAUG</strong> is an enhancenment of <strong>SMAUGFuss 1.9</strong>, the goal is to develop a new structure to build and run in modern distributed system environments.
<strong>SMAUGFuss 1.9</strong>, an fixed <strong>SMAUG 1.4a</strong> which is a heavily modified derivative of the <strong>Merc 2.1</strong> distribution.
<strong>SMAUG 1.4a</strong> is close to six times the size of <strong>Merc 2.1</strong>, and has major changes to the inner workings of the code, hence making porting of code from other Diku-derivatives non-trivial to the non-coder.
Due to the ability to edit most everything online, you will most likely find the online help pages more informative.
<strong>SMAUG</strong> is the base code that runs the popular <strong>Realms of Despair</strong> MUD. Through the years it has been tweaked, modified, and enhanced to become one of the most feature packed branches of the <strong>MERC</strong> family of codebases.
<strong>SMAUG</strong> is a derivative of <strong>Merc Diku Mud</strong> is a <strong>Diku Mud</strong> with many enhancements and contributions.</p>

<h3>Support or Contact</h3>
<p>Having trouble with <strong>XSMAUG</strong>?
First, check out the documentation at <strong><a href="https://github.com/smaugmuds/xmerc/wiki">XSMAUG Wiki</a></strong> or send an Issue and we’ll help you sort it out.
We rewrote all of the documentation files for the <strong>XSMAUG 2.0 Phoenix Release</strong>, and have been keeping them up-to-date since.
Also check the <strong>'wizhelp'</strong> command and read the <strong>'help'</strong> descriptions for the individual immortal commands.
When you write us, we need to know what kind of machine you're running on.  If you can give us specific information about the problem, that helps too.
Specific information means: an adb or gdb stack trace (if you're reporting a crash), or a syslog with the relevant commands logged.  The player files are ascii files -- dump them into your mail message too.
You can also read the Documentation in the <strong>'doc'</strong> directory.</p>

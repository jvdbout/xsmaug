<p><strong>XSMAUG</strong> is a multiplayer text-based role-playing game, which is a type of MUD. Commonly referred to as simply
"Diku", the game was greatly inspired by AberMUD,[1][3] though Diku became one of the first multi-user games to become popular
as a freely-available program for its gameplay and similarity to Dungeons & Dragons.</p>
<p><strong>XSMAUG</strong> is an enhancenment of <strong>SMAUGFuss 1.9</strong>, the goal is to develop a new structure to build and run in modern distributed system environments.
<strong>SMAUGFuss 1.9</strong>, an fixed <strong>SMAUG 1.4a</strong> which is a heavily modified derivative of the <strong>Merc 2.1</strong> distribution.
<strong>SMAUG 1.4a</strong> is close to six times the size of <strong>Merc 2.1</strong>, and has major changes to the inner workings of the code, hence making porting of code from other Diku-derivatives non-trivial to the non-coder.
Due to the ability to edit most everything online, you will most likely find the online help pages more informative.
<strong>SMAUG</strong> is the base code that runs the popular <strong>Realms of Despair</strong> MUD. Through the years it has been tweaked, modified, and enhanced to become one of the most feature packed branches of the <strong>MERC</strong> family of codebases.

ExDescKey    two surviving planes~
ExDesc       There are multiple layers of the Abyss each ruled by a demon
Lord or Prince.   The most common mode of  transportation to
another plane is gained through a portal.  Often these magic
portals are  only one direction, leaving the  poor traveller
stranded beyond the portal  and at the mercy of whatever lay
on the other side.   It should be noted that some planes are
deadly to human and humanoid life, being located near the
negative material plane.   One should be prepared to face
any number of demi-god like fiends who control legions of
foul  creatures each  able to destroy  an entire village.

Some demonlords are know to be immune to particular kinds of

fits of rage and use the fighting styles of warriors,  while
others rely on powerful magic or breath attacks.  One should
always use  caution when  battling  a  demon prince or lord.

against one wall.   You notice that you are not alone.   You 
have entered  the study of  the Demon Prince of  the Undead, 
Orcus.  The  vault door leads back south,  or you can decend 
through a portal into, what you think,  is another  plane of 
the Abyss.  That is if Orcus has not ripped you to shreds by

you can head west towards a palace of ice,  or go down into
a cold, ice covered wasteland.

west there is a gate in the fence, and beyond a great windswept
plain stretches for as  far as the eye can see.   A strong wind
blows  the dried grasses that grow along the edge of the fence.
Oddly enough, a portal hangs a few feet above the ground at the
near side of the cemetary, probably leading to another plane in
the Abyss.

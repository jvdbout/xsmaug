Recognition~
You suddenly realize that you are on Sesame Street. From the looks of it
this is not the same street you once knew and loved. The streets are fairly
empty and filled with trash and graffiti. You wonder what has become of this
once proud neighborhood. There is a door to a small house to the east, or you
can proceed down the street.

hook you see Lenny's head rotting away. On another, you see Worthy's half-eaten
torso. On yet another hook, you see the individual body parts of Macaroni,
Cookie, Res, and Lok. On the far wall, you see the half eaten leg of Snikt, 
while rats chew on the remains of RoX and Dizzy. Garth is here also, his echos
of grief can still be heard. you sigh with relief as you notice that you still
have your body parts.

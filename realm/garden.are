say Long ago, this garden used to be a grand palace owned by a powerful
say wizard named Arokal. He spent many centuries weaving his magic
say into this palace, making it the envy of all who beheld it.
mpsleep 3
say Soon, after he had finished, he realized that time had taken it's
say toll on his body, and he was dying. This was very troubling, so he
say spent his last few days preparing a ritual to invoke an evil spirit,
say which he could bond his life force with, thus, becoming immortal.
ponder
mpsleep 5
say The ritual went awry at some point, and although he became immortal,
say his soul became tainted by evil. Soon after, his corruption spread
say throughout the land, causing much pain and suffering.
stare
say Several years later, three heros stepped forward, and attempted
say to stop Arokal. The gathered many warriors from around the realm to
say take up arms against this evil menace. The war waged on for
say a year and a day, causing much of the great palace to be destroyed.
sigh
mpsleep 3
say The heros were losing the battle very quickly, and decided to 
say forfeit their lives to save the others. With the help of a local
say mage, they trapped their sould within three stones representing
say the main aspects of life : Creation, Chaos, and Balance.
hmm
mpsleep 3
say The mage also created 10 seals, each imbued with a special power.
say When combined with the seals, the stones can be used to create
say a powerful rune, which was used to utterly destroy Arokal for all
say eternity. Sadly, he was murdered by the evil mage's assassins before
say he could give the warriors the last rune...they succeeded in
say destroying Arokal...or so they thought, but he is back now. Without
say the last seal, the ritual cannot be completed properly and the
say evil will keep returning. All has been peaceful until now.
say The magic imbued within these grounds caused this beautiful garden
say to appear. It has been peaceful for a long time, but now the
say great evil has returned. Please, search these lands and find the
say seals, along with the stones, so we can destroy him forever!
em look solemn for a moment.
mpsleep 3
say He is causing the weather to turn bad, and this garden is dying because
say of it. Ask the people here about it. They are a friendly lot, just
say ask them about the "strange weather", or the "stones". Please find them

feet above you. Birds fly high above and the sun's radiance shines pleasantly.
There are many ancient stone pillars and crumbled statues strewn about, this

Scanning the horizon, you notice that the weather is much different in

The top of the tower is seemingly incomplete, several large pillars stand 
around the edges, but other than that, there are no visible walls. You begin to
realize that mabye this was planned, as the tower has no roof as well. The 
large pool of crystal water in the center seems to slowly drain down below, 
creating the magnificent waterfall you saw below. The stars shine brightly on
one particular spot, as you follow the beam downward, your eyes meet with those
of a celestial being.

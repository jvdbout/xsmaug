Baalzebul's Skull:
 
     In fact there were several skulls made by cult of Baalzebul.  The
process in which the skulls were made is unknown, but the powers have
been well documented.  Each skull has a number of healing spells cast
upon them, much like a staff or orb.  However to activate the magical
powers one must hold the item, causing the user to be teleported to a
random location.  The charges are limited and when completely used, it
explodes sending shards of crystal everywhere.  Caution should be used
when handling one of these skulls.
 
Note: Users have complained of a physical and mental burden while they
are carring this object.  Most users either are never heard from again
or are maimed in the skulls explosion.

Bottom of a Rugged Path~
Standing here at the bottom of some jagged cliffs, a trail is visible

Partially-Collapsed Building~
There is something dark and sinister about this building.  There is no
sign of any little girl, or that anyone has lived here for a very long
time.  All that remains of the building are a couple of walls and some
broken timbers.  A sagging doorframe is to the north, leading back on
to a road.

straight and replaced if broken.  Now most of the tiles are broken or

Here, in the darkest recess of the tower, a horde of writhing maggots
are feeding upon whatever unlucky being wanders into the area.  While
individually harmless, when encountered in numbers they can prove to
be quite deadly.  They do not seem to have a preferance for living or
undead flesh.  Various bones and trinkets are scattered about here.

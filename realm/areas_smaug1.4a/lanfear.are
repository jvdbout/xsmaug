A Path Through the Forest~
You are walking along a path through a dense forest.  Beautiful trees of
numerous variety stands on either side, their boughs casting a comfortable
shade over your head.  It appears the ground here was razed long ago, and
nature has still failed to reclaim it for herself.  As you walk along you
hear the scamper of tiny feet into the brush at your approach, along with
the happy chirping of the many birds that call this place home.  The path
continues east and west.

The Edge of the Forest~
You are standing at the edge of a great ancient forest which stretches 
off to the east.  The trees are grown thinkly together, but you can see
the path you are standing on continue east as it winds its way through
the ancient elms and oaks.  West the path winds gently down to a beach,
where the base of a brilliant golden bridge glimmers in the sunlight over
a shimmering sea of blue.

The Beach~
You are standing on the white sandy shore of a long beach.  The coastline
stretches to the horizon north and south of you, and west a shimmering sea
of blue sparkles as it reflects the sun's rays.  A path leading down from
a dense forest off to the east meets the base of a giant golden bridge here,
which spans the sea as it crosses to an island kingdom to the west.  The 
bridge is of beautiful construction, arcing up smoothly into the air then 
down at the shore of the island.  The bridge gleams brightly against the 
shining sun, and you wonder if there is a place as beautiful as where you
are now in all of Aesir.

The Top of the Golden Bridge~
You are standing atop a might golden bridge which spans the sparkling sea
beneath you. To the west, the bridge descends to meet the gates of a large
island, upon which sits a city encircled by a giant wall of white stone.
Above the wall you can see many gleaming turrets, and a small flag fluttering
in the wind.  The bridge lands on the shore right before a set of tall
silver gates in the stone wall, which are now open to all travellers who
seek refuge from the wild.  East the bridge meets the mainland, and in the
distance you see a massive forest stretch into the distance.

Outside the Gates of Lanfear~
You are standing just outside the walls of the beautiful island city of
Lanfear.  Towering walls of solid white stone stretch up above your head,
following the shore around the edge of the island.  Where the wall breaks,
two mighty gates of solid silver stand thrown open, offering entrance to
you and any other adventurers who pass this way.  The end of a mighty golden
bridge meets the shore here, and arcs off to the east above a glimmering
sea to meet the mainland.  Overhead seagulls soar through the air, crying out
occasionally as they speed over the surf.

of peace, as if this place has alwys been your home and always will be.
A small station sits to the north, with a sign above the door marking it
as the gatekeeper's post.  A clean smooth cobblestone road runs east outside
the gates or west further into town.  A small general store stands with 
open doors to the north.

East Lanfear Way~
You are walking down Lanfear Way, the central road of this glorious city,
which cross from one side of the island to the other.  People move about
performing their tasks for the day, presenting the image of a flourishing
economy.  Most of the stores here seem to deal in clothing and outdoor gear,
and cater to travellers just entering town or on the way out for some great
adventure.  A building with a silver globe over the door sits to the north,
with the name Maps Express etched into a glass window.  South, large plate
glass windows reveal fresh meats and breads ready for your picking at
the Lanfear St. Deli.

As you walk into this classy little store, your nose is assaulted by an
assortment of smells which make your mouth water.  Small cases filled with
ice hold a variety of fine meats wrapped in cheeseskin, and freshly baked
breads rest in bins or hang from the ceiling.  A skinny man wearing a stark
white apron with a pencil on his ear stands behind a counter placing items
in large paper bags for other customers.

small wooden mannequins wear glimmering suits of silver armor, shining
brightly in the noon sun.  South stands a large building with a picture of
an anvil hanging over the door, with the words "Dolgan's Forge" painted

Lanfear and offering almost every type of armor you can think of.  Anything
you desire can be found here, from cheap leather tunics to outrageously 
expensive tabards of solid gold.  A hefty muscled figure, probably a retired
warrior, sits on a stool in the rear of the shop whistling as he rubs a
silver shield with a polished cloth.

expensive ones in cases or hanging on the wall, with the less valuable
weapons standing in large barrels.  Behind a thick black curtain in the rear
you can hear the 'ding!' of metal against metal, as the owner busies himself
crafting yet more weaponry.  Sensing a customer, the black curtain parts and
Dolgan enters the room, coughing slightly then winking at you with a smile.

Pennants bearing the crests of the clans of Lanfear flutter in the gentle
winds off the sea, and gulls cry out into the air as they circle overhead.
The portcullis is now open, welcoming all visitors whose journeys take them

The Avenue du Blanc~
You are walking on the Avenue du Blanc, which here borders a quite seedy
section of town.  People walk along the road, glancing at you suspiciously,
and you see an old man riding a unicycle shake his fist at you as he 
rides by.  A small child comes up to you and tries to sell you a glass of
lemonade, and you charitably give her 10 times the price she named.

The Avenue du Blanc~
You are at the southern end of the Avenue du Blanc, which lies near the heart
of the poor quarter of Lanfear.  The people glance at you, wondering who 
you are and what you are doing here, but no one makes an effort to confront
you.  You notice a city work crew busily working on the stones of the avenue,
wiping them down and sweeping them clean.  Too bad they can't clean up the
rest of the neighborhood.  The Avenue heads back north, and Smuggler's Way
runs to the west along the southern wall of the island.

Smuggler's Way~
You are standing on Smuggler's Way, which here runs through the poor section
of Lanfear, filled with houses jumbled together and too many people living
in them.  Broken bottle line the street, and pieces of paper flutter in 
the wind.  The only break in the dreariness is to the north, where a well
tended wall surround the grounds of the Lanfear Abbey, home for the monks
of the city, who spend their time and effort educating and taking care of
the less fortunate citizens of the town.

neighborhood of small homes with small lots built closely together, home
for the blue*collar workers of Lanfear. Looking around, you see the 
surroundings gradually grow worse heading east, but the area seems to be 
fairly decent if modest as it nears Sunnyvale Lane to the west.

north through the heart of the island.  A wide, well-tended grassy 
median lined with palm trees heads north toward the glimmering spires
of the palace far in the distance to the north.  The houses around here
are modest, homes for hard working families who are just able to make
decent lives for themselves.  The area here is well policed, as many
of the upper class families head down Sunnyvale on the weekends for
the Lanfear Beach, which lies through an opening in the city wall to 
the south.

about average, a community of the hard working middle-clas families of
town.  The houses here seem to be a little nicer and more expensive than
those to the west, probably because of their proximity to Sunnyvale Lane
and the beaches nearby to the south.

in cheesy beach shorts stands near where the water is breaking, offering 
rides on a huge floating wooden horse.  You really cant go very far out

drinking a banana daiquiri.  He appears to be one of the monkey people
you have heard about, almost completely human except for his distinctly
ape-like features.  Beren looks at you and exclaims 'Well I'll be a

mage who runs this shop, had worked out a deal with the mages so he can
make some of their brews available to the public.  Hormel is sitting
on a stool in the back of the room now, using his magical talents to heat
up a can of chili.  Maybe all that chili is why the other mages made him
retire so early...

out any troublemakers or blow the whistle if the cops come snooping around.

Renaldo is currently dressed up in a clown suit, jumping on a trampoline
while smoking a cigarette.  Seeing you enter, he bounces from the 
trampoline and crashes at your feet, amazingly without losing his cigarette.
As he greets you, you get a huge whiff of vodka from his red rubber nose.

mix of sun rays and torchlight.  The Knight-Marshal of Lanfear, Kins, is
here making sure no one gets out of hand while on the royal grounds, and
running the day to day affairs of the island in the absence of Neutopia.
Fortunately, Neutopia has instituted some social programs, such as the
Citywide Donation Fund through which unwanted items can be distributed
to the needier citizens of Lanfear.  The storage rooms for these items
are located down from here in the cellar, and are open to the public.
Lanfear Chapel is north, the national treasury is west, and a single
winding staircase leads up from here to the top of the castle.

sigh
say It all began years ago, when a man named Lord Aaron Dregoria was
say appointed to rule this area by a long forgotten king. This area
say had no real name, but was soon called the Dregos Mountains after
say Lord Aaron. Aaron was a kind and just ruler, but not only that, he
say was a powerful Magi. He enjoyed the solitude of his rule for the
say very reason that he could research his art. But, Aaron was a man,
say and time takes its toll on the mortal frame, and Aaron aged, grew
say feeble and weak. Aaron began to seek ways to cheat death, and in a
say stroke of madness, turned to the dark arts of Necromancy. Aaron
say soon uncovered an ancient rite, which created a potion that would
say bear a gruesome state of undeath upon the imbider. And thus, Aaron
say Dregoria became a lich, the dark ruler of the Dregos Mountains. But
say Aaron's exploits were unfinished, and his experimentation in the dark
say arts continued fervently. And, as fate would have it, Aaron found a
say young gold dragon named Kronia Gulga. Aaron befriended the dragon
say under the guise of illusion, and continued for many decades. Yet, one
say day, an experiment went awry, leaving the dragon mortally wounded.
say Aaron hastily created another potion, of the type he had already imbided
say years hence, and fed it to the dying dragon, curious to see the effect
say of the dark brew upon the dragon. The dragon writhed and died, its flesh
say flaying from its bones. And thus, Blacktalon was born. Filled with rage
say and self-awareness of its undeath, Blacktalon began a war upon Aaron
say which is still on going today, a lich and a dracolich locked in
say eternal hatred.
sigh
say That is my tale.

The Dregos Mountains~
Your legs pulse with relief as you approach the plateau you have been
walking towards for hours. The flat land looks larger now that you
can see it close up. The air here chills you to the bone, and you are
sure it's not just the altitude. An ancient guide sign stands not 
twenty feet away, along the path leading to the east. Your eyes drift
beyond the sign to a large, black forest, to which the path leads.
You can barely find signs of use, but in comparison to the northern
path, this trail seems a highway. Your eyes follow the northern road
until a great black peak fills your vision. You feel your heart skip
a beat looking upon this fell mountain...

Approaching the Forest~
The path approaching the forest slopes downward slightly, much to your
relief. Glancing at the foliage ahead of you, you notice that the
trees themselves look dead. Not a bird sings, no squirrels scamper
and no wildlife can be seen. Only the shrill wind makes any noise at
all. Shadows seem to dance about in the forest which lies to the East.
Perhaps the Western plateau would be a better place.

Within the Forest~
Despite the apparent lack of leaves on the trees, the forest canopy
obscures all light. Shadows dance about the trees, in an all to
lifelike manner. The only light is the path to the West which exits
the forest. Before you, the trail forks. The Eastern path seems worn
when compared to the Northeastern and Southeastern paths. A biting
chill seems to pervade the Northeastern path, while the forest seems
to grow thicker to the Southeast.

An Ancient Path~
The path upon which you walk seems ancient. Cobwebs obscure your
vision, as does the dust which stirrs from the unused trail. A chill
seems to penetrate your clothing the farther you traverse this path.
You begin to hear an eerie song, coming from the Northeast. The song
chills you more than the unnatural cold. Even the silent forest to
the Southwest would seem a haven.

Pushing through the layers of cobwebs, you find yourself on a decaying
cobblestone road. To the East, you can make out the ruins of an old
Villa. The haunting song is louder now, and obviously coming from the
Villa to the East. The road turns Southwest here, leading to the dark
forest.

An Ancient Causeway~
The crumbling road leads into the center of the blasted community. It
looks like a war has been waged here in the street. Blackend rubble
is strewn about carelessly like some giant casually tossing toys. In
the stonework, great furrows can be seen, like a giant beast attacked
the buildings themselves. The haunting song is much louder now, almost
alluring, pulling you Eastward, towards the Villa itself. To the North,
the ruins of an ancient building stand, and you catch a glimpse of
movement inside. The road leads to the West, back towards the silent
forest.

The savage destruction outside these ruins has not been carried into
this structure, much to your reprive. There is almost a welcoming
feel about this place. Stone tables carved from structures in the
floor is the only furniture present. Not even a door leads back to
the blasted street to the South. A hint of movement catches your eye
in the corner of the room.

gruesome. The Villa itself can be seen to the Northeast, the location
of the haunting song which has tormented you this far. The road curves
to the West, leading back to the outskirts of the Villa and the forest.

You stand before the decaying structure that once was a beautiful
Villa. You wonder how the structure still stands, as the damage
done to the surrounding area is truly awesome. An old oaken door
stands to the North, allowing passage into the building. An old
and crumbling cobblestone road leads back to the blasted ruins to
the Southwest.

Stepping into this ruined building takes every element of bravery you
can muster. The reek of wooden decay fills your nostrils and the eerie
song echoes from the North, beating into your brain. The song seems
that it could drive you mad, if you stay too long. A heavy oaken door
stands to the South.

As you step from the hallway, an eerie silence overcomes you... the
song has stopped. Has it been your imagination this whole time? You
force yourself to disregard such delusional thoughts, and back to
reality. A hallway branches East and West here, while a dark, and
strangely mornful room lies to the North.

A Mournful Rest~
Upon entering this room, a feeling of cold malice envelopes you. To
your suprise, this room is pristene, well furnished, and strikingly
beautiful. A canopy bed rests against the wall, with a figure under
the blanket. A closer look reveals a skeleton stripped completley
of flesh. The doorway to the South seems welcoming now, as you
realize the source of the dreadful song...

decay. The walls are cracked and crumbling, almost to a point of
caving in on themselves. A framless doorway lies on the Western
side of the room, leading into the heart of the Villa.

Deeper in the Forest~
The path you followed from the Northwest is quickly swallowed by the
forest. The trees have grown dense and impassable in most places, as
the shadows seem to encroach everywhere. The silence is deafening,
and the trees seem to have a hungry feeling to them, a hunger for
blood. A thorny thicket seems to be the only passable terrain, to the
South.

disturbingly long thorns. You doubt that you could even cut your
way through without getting pierced. The thicket grows less dense
to the North and the East.

The End of the Tangle~
Pushing your way through the thorny thicket is pure torture. You start
to wonder if there will be an end to it. You try not to think about
the first thorn that pricked you, how it sucked the blood which flowed
free. As you begin to drown yourself in hopeless thoughts, you can see
a clearing to the South. Something inside of you nags to keep moving
to the East, to find the end of the thicket, or to go back to where the
thicket started, to the West.

A Wrong Turn...~
You lunge free of the tangle of thorns and twisted branches, untill
you look at your new surroundings. The ground explodes before you as
a tangle of roots grasps your legs. You hack and slice at them with
all the strength you can muster, but to no avail. You pray for a
quick death, but your god has forsaken you, as you are buried alive.
You are dead.

Deeper in the Forest~
The knotted tangle of thorny vines slowly gives way to the dense wood
of the silent forest. Taking a few moments to remove the numerous
thorns which have imbedded themselves in your flesh, you realize that
the forest has grown more dense, if that is possible. The darkness is
opressive, almost tangible. The thicket to the West, though painful,
felt more secure than this. Muttering to yourself as you wonder if
you have gotten lost in this God-forsaken forest, a movement catches
your eye. To your amazement, the trees have parted to the East.

The Shadows Path~
As you walk into this strange path, shadows begin to creep over you.
The trees seem to be forcing you in a particular direction, and from
what you can tell, it is directly to the center of this dread forest.
The path leads back towards the thicket to the west, and into deeper
shadows to the South.

step. You can feel a presence, something horrible, nearby. The path
splits here, leading North and East. Every nerve in your body cries
for you to turn back Northwest.

Whatever the source of this evil is, lies to the South.

A Well Worn Path~
To your suprise, a well worn path runs East and West here. Regardless
of the hideous nature of the forest, people seemed to have settled in
this land. At least you hope its people... The silence of the forest
continues, almost maddening. You can only hope you encounter any form
of civilization soon.

A Well Worn Path~
The well used path continues deeper through the forest. Far in the
distance, you can see the end of this dreary forest. It seems that the
people here have taken the shortest route through this place. The path
stretches West, towards the forest edge, and Northeast, towards a tiny
clearing.

A Small Clearing~
The canopy breaks here slightly, allowing sunlight to shine through
the branches like a full moon. This cmall clearing in any other wood
would be overlooked for a better resting place, but in this dreary
forest, this clearing is a great reprive. It would appear that many
travelers have made camp here, over the years. Southwest leads back
towards the forest edge, while Southeast presses on.

Nearing the Forest End~
As you traverse the snaky path, you feel an overwhelming happiness,
you can see the forest's end. Quickening your pace, you hope to soon
be away from this maddening place. Sunlight breaks to the East, while
shadows obscure the Western path.

Exiting the Forest~
Your pace quickens to a near run as you approach the cavernous opening
to the forest. As you draw closer to the clearing, you stop in wonder.
Before you lies a cliff which marks the edge of the plateau, and from
it, a hazy mist obscures the bottom. Yet looking across the horizion
is perhaps the most beautiful view you have ever seen. Finding it
difficult to pry your eyes away, you notice a narrow cliff which leads
to the Northeast. A small part of you remembers that the way back is to
the West.

A Narrow Cliff~
You begin to traverse this narrow and slippery cliff. The fall below
you is obscured by a thick mist, you wonder if it might actually be
bottomless. The cliff itself is barely wide enough for you, let alone
anyone else. The ciff slopes upward sightly to the Northeast, and back
to a dark forest to the Southwest.

in this new plateau. You are almost above the tree line at this point,
only the most rugged vegetation can be found. To your suprise, you can
make out the walls of a settlement to the Northeast. Any form of human
life might be favored over the path back down the mountain to the West.

lone settlement in these mountains. You can make out details in the
gatehouse, which is well armed and armored. After traversing the dark
forest, you do not question the amount of precautions these people
take. The Gates lie to the East, while the Southwest leads off this
plateau.

The Gates of Dregoria~
Because of the lack of vegetation on this plateau, your coming has been
seen from quite a distance. The Gatehouse itself, while in need of new
coats of paint, is a marvel in defensive architechture. Great ballistai
rest on the short towers, and numerous arrow slits can be seen. Great
butresses make the short guard towers almost impervious to any form of
structural damage. The Gates themselves are small and short, the opening
easily defended from large forces by only a few soldiers. Only three
soldiers stand on active duty as of now. East lies the streets of the
village of Dregoria, while West leads back to the plateau. North and South
lead into the well defended guard towers.

the village of Dregoria from forces unknown. An impressive number of
pikes line the walls here, as well as arrow slits that allow for the
archers to reign death on their opponents while staying defended. The
stone itself seems magically sown. Who built this place? To the South,

Intersection of Perimeter Road and Central Street~
Once you clear the mighty gates, your eyes fall upon the village of
Dregoria. At first glance, you would not give this village a second
thought, but thats your first glance. The buildings here seem to be
a mixture of mindless apathy and a strong need to defend the home. A
few of the houses could hold out against small armies. Others look
completly ransacked. To the Northeast, a great manor can be seen, up
upon a cliff, perhaps a mile away. The East road leads towards the
village square. The Southeast seems to run a circuit of the village.
West leads to the gates.

making a truly formidable defense. Little signs of activity can be

obviously taken its toll on the aesthetics of these people. To the East,
an intersection can be seen, and the road continues to the Southwest.

magnitude to defend a sheer drop? The road continues along the wall to
the Southeast and back to the gates to the Northwest.

North and the South are grey colored houses. Central Street runs to the
East, to where you can see a small village square, and to the West, you
can see the village gates.

A cloud of dust rises to obscure your vision as you step into this room.
This room appears to have been a study, small bookshelves line the wall,
but remain empty. A few books lie on old stools, their titles obscured
by an impressive layer of dust. A window upon the south wall allows a
view of the village below, and some of the forest as well. To the West,
a door leads to a foyer.

Entering the Manor~
Walking into this wide hallway brings you within the manor proper. A
thick layer of dust coats everywhere it can cling, obscuring the walls
and accompanying paintings. Once, this hallway would have been a spectacle
to see, but now, its degenerated into this from years of neglect. To
the South, a foyer can be seen, and a landing to the North.

A Landing~
A wide double staircase fills this room, and most of your sight along
with it. Made of polished marble, it perhaps cost a fortune in its own
right. Redwood walls and granite pillars adorn this chamber, and even
after the years of negligence, it still maintains its original beauty.
The stairs lead up to a balcony overlooking this room, and a passage can
be seen between them to the North. A hallway lies to the South, leading
to the main doors of the manor.

A Junction of Hallways~
Stepping through a small corridor brings you to a four way junction.
Redstone tiles adorn the floors in intricate and difficult to follow
patterns. The walls are made from the same redwood as the rest of the
manor appears to be. The hallway leading South leads to a landing, and
the Northern hallway leads to a large library. East and West lead into
the manor.

Bookshelves fill this spacious room, perhaps more books then anyone has
ever seen together at once. Suprisingly, this room seems to be in good
repair as opposed to the rest of the manor. Hardly a trace of dust can
be found. A doorway to the South leads to a hallway, and a small door
can be seen to the North.

Aaron's Study~
This room once appeared to be a spacious study, but now it is filled
with cluttered notes, maps and tomes. A reading desk sits in alone
in the corner, stacked high with scrawled notes. Maps of Dregoria and
the surrounding areas line the walls. A small door lies on the South

A Long Hallway~
This hallway is narrow and dark, with no windows or light sources to
be seen. Footsteps echo loudly on redstone tile, and each step rouses
years of dust. The walls are bare, and unadorned, making this a very
lonely place to be. A sitting room can be seen to the South, and to
the North, the hallway stretches on.

of it. Two small bookshelves are against the wall, holding books which
ease the mind to read. A long hallway lies to the South, while a musty
smell comes from the East.

A candle is burning upon a small desk, beside a smoky mirror, casting

as if you are being watched. A slight breeze stirrs, though you can
find no window or source. A velvet stool sits before the desk, and you
can see numerous books in shelves, all almost destroyed from the water.
Hallways lead to the East and West from here.

A cursory glance brings your attention to the nature of this room, that
of a music room. Musical instruments are everywhere here, a large piano
rests in the corner, and a large harp stands in the middle of the room.
Most of the instruments appear to be in poor repair, strings corroded
or wood tarnished. A strange energy fills this room, almost haunting.
To the South, a long hallway can be seen, and to the West, a dank and
dusty hall.

wooden chairs here to pulp over the years, and etched the walls slightly.

dusty hallway, and a door to the East leads back towards the heart of

the walls, while jars of vile concoctions rest on shelves. To the South,
lies a stone hallway, and the laboratory continues to the North.

A Room of Binding~
Horror and hate coalesce into reality, swirling and warping the rest
of the mundane world, making the pale walls seem insubstantial. This
seems to be a focal point of negative and dark energies, summoned from
the Abyss itself. Images of horror beyond comprehension materalize for
a moment, then dissipate, but for all you know, they existed in this
reality for a short time. The energies are nearly unbearable, tearing
at your body, mind and soul. The exit to the South seems miles away,
even though the energies here cause you unberable pain, it is like a
putrid sweetness, a release of unbearble weight. You have visions of
yourself, a warlord pillaging kingdoms, burning the innocent alive. You
are a cannibal, eating the flesh from your still living and screaming
victim. You are a necromancer, causing undescribable pain upon innocents,
only to heal them and maim them again, you are a preist, abusing the
power of your position to perform unspeakable acts of human sacrifice,
you are a.... lost in an infinity of alternate personalities, lost in
the dark side of your soul... you dream on... hate... hate...

The path grows shadowed as it begins to pass between two steep cliffs
and becomes a pass, leading towards the ominous black spire. Because
of the curvature of the path, it is almost impossible to tell what
dangers lie ahead. The wind makes a low keening through the walls of
the mountains, making you wish you were elsewhere. To the South, you

Before an Ancient Bridge~
A large and once magnificent bridge lays before you to the North, its
frame now showing advanced signs of decay. It crosses a deep gorge,
some two hundred feet across. On the far side, you can see the black
spire in its entirety. Thunderheads swim around the spire in a cyclonic
dance, which should be impossible by all means. Shadows seem to sprint
to and fro around the peak of the spire. Encompassed by this sight, you
almost do not notice the old guard outpost to the East, and the pass
leading South.

You look up, then shake your head, then look up again. That was some
fall, its a miracle you lived. The wall is truly unclimable, and the
intense winds would make flying up a one way trip to the grave. You
have landed upon a small cliff, something of a natural bridge. The
gorge of course, continues down. You cannot see the bottom. Looking
around, you notice a passageway to the South, an entrance to some form
of underground structure. It would appear to be your only option at

to see. You find no signs of inhabitation, which is probably a good
fortune. From the lack of dust, you could deduce that this temple is
visited often, but you shudder at what might come here. Exits East and
West lead to small rooms, while North and South leads to other areas
of the temple.

Deeper within the Temple~
The darkness grows deeper, almost opressive as the temple grows deeper
within the mountain. The glowing runes are more numerous here, seeming
to lead to a flickering chamber to the South. Chambers lie to the East and
West as well, and a faint light can be seen to the North. You get a bad
feeling about this place.

A Flickering Chamber~
Outside the fact that reddish grey lightning arcs throughout this room
periodically, this chamber resembles much of the rest of the temple. The
density of runes increases drastically here, the dull red glow now bright
by comparison to the rest of the temple. The lightning which arcs has no
obvious source, save the dull red runes which pulse with dark light. The
trace hints of ozone is noticable in the air. The longer you stay here, the
more you feel a strange pull...

Spartan would describe this room best, no decor, and only a straw bed

grooves which appear to be claw marks marr the walls. The only exit you

A depression sinks in the middle of this chamber, holding all mannner
of waste products. The stench is vile, almost poisonous to your lungs.
No markings adorn this room, only the depression makes it any less a
plain cube. An opening to the East leads back to the temple.

The chamber here does not appear to support human occupants, or even
mortal ones for that matter. Runes cover the chamber, which glow dimly
with red light. A weapon rack has been built into the wall, holding
weapons of immense size. Whatever lives here isn't friendly. An opening
leads back into the temple to the West.

Timeless washes over you, holding you for an infinite number of lives,
before rudely spitting you out here. The platform looks unstable, over
a sea of boiling... blood? Where is this place? To the North lies a 
floating palace, which connects to the platform which you are on. The
palace doesn't seem to large, from here, anyway.

Within the Stronghold~
The walls of this palace seeom to be made of human flesh, piled upon
itself over and over again to give it a solid illusion. The feel of this
place is sickening. Low moans of anguished screams can be heard coming
from all directions. The Northern path leads deeper into this hellish
place, while the South leads to a sea of boiling blood.

A Final Stand~
The design of this room looks as if it was constructed to guard against
both the Northern and Southern routes. Structural defenses stand and serve
as cover as well as support. A viscious sound can be heard to the North,
something rather unpleasant. To the South lies the exit to this place. A
close examination reveals arrow slits on the East and West walls.

Chambers of the Warlord~
Painful displays of gruesome butchery line the walls of this chamber,
some as trophies, others as what the builders of this stronghold consider
art. But, the most notable feature of this room is the tall, smouldering
bronze throne which rises from the floor. The stench of burning flesh
arises where the throne and floor meet. The occupant of this chamber
must indeed be a twisted soul, if it even has a soul at all...

Approaching the Spire~
Leaving the ancient bridge would be a relief if it did not put you so
close to the black spire. The land on the North side of the bridge is
bleak and lifeless. Nothing seems to move in this land, not even the
wind seems to stir. Gazing upon the black spire, dread rolls down your
spine. The thunderheads swirl about at impossible speeds. The bridge
which leads away from this place lies to the South, while the path to
the spire is Northwest.

The view to the North slowly becomes obscured by the massive black spire,
its massive size shadowing the surrounding area. Nothing moves here,
not even a small breeze stirs. To the North, the path to the mountain
can be seen, and to the Southeast lies a small bridge.

The Gates of Darkness~
The black spire now fills your entire vision as you draw closer to the
black stone mountain. The path ends at the slope of the spire at a great
and hideous gate. The gate is enscribed with an old dialect of the common
speech, and seems to be sealed with runes of binding. The gates stand
some thirty feet tall, and would be impossible to force open. To the
South, the path away from this spire lies.

Within the Spire~
Darkness obscures everything as the gates close behind you, leaving you
trapped within the Black Spire. An eerie silence overcomes any noise
that is made, and every shadow seems too real for comfort. The tunnel
here is carved from the stone itself with no care for aesthetic sense,
winding its way into the spire. Only darkness awaits...

Into the Darkness~
The darkness envelopes you like a coccoon, light barely leaving your
vicinity before being absorbed by the inky blackness. The silence is
almost unbareable, maddening, deafining. This surreal pseudo-reality
tears at your mind like daggers, this place is not natural. The path
continues to wind into the mountain, leading onward to the Northeast,
and back to a sealed exit to the Southwest.

A Turn in the Dark~
Feeling your way through the dark tunnel, it turns sharply to the North,
leading more directly now towards the heart of the mountain. Unbearable
silence beats at your brain, and the darkness is overwhelming, absorbing
all forms of light. How much longer does this tunnel go? The tunnel turns
to the Southwest, leading back towards the sealed exit.

The darkness of these tunnels remains constant, though the walls have
begun to heat slightly. Perhaps this is a volcanoe, or perhaps some
magical form of fire awaits you. Either way, there is no turning back
now. The tunnel continues straight to the North and South.

hot to the touch now, and feeling your way through this tunnel is now
becoming painful. The passage continues to the Northwest and the South.

heat is noticable uncomfortable now. What ever lies down there is not
going to be friendly. The tunnel extends Southeast from here.

The tunnel is now hot enough to boil standing water, causing pain to
anything unfortunate enough to live here. A dim light can be seen to
the North, as well as occasional waves of heat. Armor becomes heavier
by the moment, the heat sapping the strength of anything living. Up
leads to cooler tunnels.

a raging inferno, carved from liquid elemental fire. South lies cooler
tunnels, which seems a positive option.

tricks with your mind. Tunnels dance in and out of existance in this
realm, each one as real as a mirage, yet no other option presents itself.
Without any form of protection, you doubt you can survive long in this
realm of fire.

Living Shadows~
The torrents of fire quickly die down as you are thrust from the intense
heat. There does not seem to be any way back to the flames, which is not
immediatley bad, but here, the darkness is overwhelming. The shadows seem
to be piled on top of one another, thicker and thicker, untill you are
sure they are moving. A dim light shows an exit to the North.

Nearing the Beast~
The trial of fire recesses like a bad nightmare, almost like it was a
dream, which left you in a void of darkness. The shadows move here, and
some seem solid, sharp, and aggressive. You only have one way to go,
now, which is the path curving to the Northwest. The tunnel leading to
the South only dead ends, and the shadowbeast might not be dead.

Closer to the Darkness~
You are no longer certain that you lie within the black spire, but the
darkness continues to grow and become thicker. To the West, a great
rumbling can be heard, something not associated with the natural sounds
of a mountain. Southeast leads to a dead end...

The Belly of the Beast~
A great overpowering stench can be smelt here, worse than any refuse
imaginable. The smell of one thousand dead and decaying bodies fills
youe nose, burning your lungs. The tunnel to the East leads back to
a maze of liquid fire, though the way is most certanily closed by now.
Up, leads to the lord of the Spire...

The Lair of Blacktalon~
This chamber is truly massive, some three hundred feet wide and across,
a natural cavern merged with the tunneling of some great beast. The
floor of this chamber is covered with treasure, priceless amounts of
treasure, gold, silver and platinum. The horde clould make the Gods
themselves jealous.

A faint trail~
The gates of the city slowly fade behind, leaving only a faint dirt
path through a sparse coniferous forest. To the North, a mountainous
reigon can be seen. The path is slowly ascending, heading towards the
bleak mountains.

Into the Mountains~
The forest slowly gives way to the foothills of the bleak mountains,
slowly ascending into cold air. The snow capped peaks can be seen to
the Northeast, and the gates of Tyr to the Southeast. This is obviously
the path less traveled.

Lost in the Mountains~
The foothills slowly give way to bluffs and gorges, and the cover of
the trees slowly draws away. The path grows so faint that it is impossible
to follow any longer, and only the contour of the land guides you. To
the Northwest lies a natural made path, and the Southwest leads back to
Tyr.

Nearing a Plateau~
The ascent becomes steeper and steeper, nearing the halfway point of
the bleak mountains. The trees are all but non-existant, give no cover
to any eyes which might be about. A plateau lies to the North, while
a nature trail runs Southeast.

The Top of the Spire~
The top of the spire is precariously balanced, barely any room to move
without plumeting down the mountainside. The thunderheads are almost
within your grasp, blast of lightning striking too close for comfort.
The winds are strong, and the view would be awesome if not obscured by
the dark energies surrounding the spire.

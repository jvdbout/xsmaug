prophet false~
The false prophet~
A smoke-breathing man with rams horns shouts here!
~
The false prophet is the spokesman for the beast.
He does great wonders, such as summoning fire from
heaven to gather worshippers for the beast. He seems
set on getting those around him to make an image to
the beast, which he promises to give life to and
order it to kill all those who do not worship the image.
If you will worship as he says, step forward and
receive the mark.

In the throne room~
You stand in a magnificant throne room. Multitudes and multitudes
of angles are here singing praise to the one who sits on the throne.
About you are the souls of the dead shuffling foward to be judged.

At the throne~
You grovel before the throne. He who sits at the throne
tells you 'Now is your time'. With a gesture a black
hole appears at your feet. He motions for you to go into
the hole, and resumes his Judgement.

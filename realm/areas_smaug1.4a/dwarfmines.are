young dwarf mine worker~
a mine worker~
A young dwarf is here carring supplies around.
~
This young dwarf  is  too young to fight against orc and goblin hordes
so he is working here in the mines.   After a few decades working hard
labor down here the dwarf will become strong and stout.   If times are
good he will possibly become a craftsman if they have the skill, or if
times are bad, he will be most likely join the dwarven army and go off
to slay the mortal enemies of the dwarven race.

A small dwarf is here working on the walls.

This dwarf has avoided having to battle the orcs and goblins by being
a stone cutter.  It is quiet an honor to work the stone carefully with
your hands as opposed to hacking away at it with a mining pick.  Maybe
if this stone cutter learns their trade well, they can work on a grand
project such as a Thain's burial tomb.

A thin dwarf is here distributing the supplies.

This is the dwarven quartermaster.   He hands out the supplies for the
whole mine.  You should try and barter with him for any goods you will
need if you decide  to  explore the deeper portions of the mine.  This
fellows beard is quiet long and his face  is  aged from time,  despite
the most-undwarven characteristic of being thin instead of stocky. You
think he might be conscience of  this fact because he is wearing quiet
a few layers of clothing.

A tired dwarf is here unloading rocks from the cart.

This young dwarf  is  too young to fight against orc and goblin hordes
so he is working here in the mines.   After a few decades working hard
labor down here the dwarf will become strong and stout.   If times are
good he will possibly become a craftsman if they have the skill, or if
times are bad, he will be most likely join the dwarven army and go off
to slay the mortal enemies of the dwarven race.   This assistant looks
very tired of unloading these rocks.

A goblin is here making the tunnels wider.

This goblin is smaller than the orcs, but no less ugly or smelly.  The
ugly little critter does not look very bright,  or  happy about having
to work in the mines.  It spits at you when you turn your back, but it
is not overly aggressive.

body are dirty rags,  which  you  will never even think about wearing.
The rags are stained in several places  by  who  knows what.  The most

An old dwarf is here wondering how to get out of here.
~
This  dwarf  has  been  lost down here for some time.  He is typically
short like most dwarfs.  Heis typically stout, again, like most of the
other dwarves you have seen.   His beard hangs down to his waist,  and
is somewhat tangled.   Atop his head he is wearing a brilliant diamond
studded helmet, and in his stubby hands  a  great battleaxe is wielded
tightly.  There is a look of determination in his aged eyes.  While  a
fearsome looking opponent, this guy is getting up in the years and has
passed his prime.  You think you have seen this fellow somewhere else.

A castrated bard is here thinking he is all that and a...
~
You cannot help being sorry for this pathetic creature.  This  mob  is
representative of all the 'do nothing' immortals, who in the course of
their fun-time feel it is required  of them to make laws that alienate
players and working immortals alike.  We all agree rules are important
to the survival of any organized group of individuals, however,  it is
usually the case that the ones making the rules actually contribute to
the greater good of the organization.   This mob can't build, does not
know jack about coding, probably could even manage to make a social if
their life depended on it, and wouldn't have a clue about fucking with
skills. All they know is freeze, hell, siteban, and of course, balzhur
all of which they use to overcome their insecurities in real life.  As
a player you will never see this mob, and consider yourself lucky.  If
you are an immortal,  take heed, there are words of wisdom to be found
here within this description.

Before a Dwarven Archway~
You are standing before a rather ornate archway of dwarven design.  It
is tall enough for  a  human to pass through, although they might have
to duck a few inches.  The  archway  is  inscribed with all manners of
little runes and symbols,  most being in dwarven.   Looking north into
the mines you can see a short hallway leading deeper into the unknown.

Entering the Dwarven Mines~
This short hallway connects the entrance to the large main tunnel that
runs east and west along the first floor on the mine.  This chamber is
at least wide enough to stand a dozen or so men  side  to  side.  Upon
observation, you note that there is  a  short mine-cart track ahead in
the large tunnel,  but not here,  leading out of the mine.   Obviously
whatever is mined is also processed within the immediate area as well.
To the south through an archway you see the entrance to the mines.

There  is  not  anything too elaborate about this large tunnel running
east and west.   The walls have been cut with a degree of care but are
left unfinished and bare.  A  mine-cart  track runs down the center of
this tunnel while wooden beams support the weight overhead.

Wooden beam are placed ever so often to give additional support to the
mines, not that dwarven mines would cave-in.  Tracks run the length of
this tunnel.

West End of the Large Tunnel~
The tunnel spits into passages to the north and south.  The walls have
been chipped about  to  reveal  precious  metals  and  gems,  not  for
asthetical reasons but there is  a certain degree of skill even in the
hurried swings of the dwarven miners.  Even  if  you are uncomfortable
underground,  you have little fear of this place falling in on itself.
That just does not happen in dwarf mines.  The mine tracks  end  here.
The main tunnel leads back to the east.

The  cramped  passage  opens  up into a small natural cavern.  Perhaps
there was once something here, a vien of silver, nuggets of ore, maybe
even a diamond, but if anything was here,  it has found by the dwarven
miners who seem to be able to smell out the goodies. But on the bright
side,  at least this cave provides a place to turn instead of crawling

something.  But no, nothing anything has been left.  Damn dwarves.

chambers of the dwarves.  All manners  of  picks,  shovels,  lanterns,
grappling hooks,  spikes,  hammers,  you  name  it,  and  it is  here.
Unfortunately there is not a miner class  on  most muds,  so  you will
have to sift through this stuff you  do  not really know much about to
find out if there are any magical picks, or enchanted grappling hooks.
You realize these passages are travelled  by  the  dwarves  every  day
before  and  after work returning their tools.  Once you are done here
you can return to the well worn passage to the east,  unless you could

Smaller branches split off to the east and west.  The main branch runs
north towards the main tunnel or south at a slight decline.  There are

Entering the Forge~
Here a worked,  although not ornate,  stone  archway of dwarven design
separates the mine from the forge  in which the various ores mined are
fashioned into weapons and armor.  The dwarves  are  reknown for their
ability to craft weapons of quality and make extremely durable armors.
To the south you can see the a chamber lighted by a great forge, while
to the north you can see a large tunnel running east and west.

Center of the Massive Forge~
You are standing in the middle of a massive forge.  Here are the giant
bellows which fan the intense flames to the south in what is the large
furance you have ever seen.  There are also anvils along with tools of
the trade found all about this  chamber.  To  the south there are many
openings into the furnace, although it is not advisable to enter them.
To the west is a large pool  in which water is fetched and then placed
in smaller troughs beside the anvils and workstations.   East there is
what appears to be a storage area of some kind. From the looks of this
place, you figure that ten or so smiths could easily work here without
getting in each others way.  To the north  a  stone archway leads back
into the mines.

This area is used to store some of the dwarven ore used to make items.
It should be noted that none of  the rare and potientally magical ores
are stored here.   Neither  are  the precious gems or nuggets of gold.
Even still, guards are posted  to  keep folk away from the ore and out
of the guildhall below.  The central area of the forge is to the west.

There  is  a  huge pool of water here.   The pool is filled with cool,

it  could have also been carved and filled with water.   Either way it
looks very deep.   The edge of the pool has a half meter stonework lip
to contain the water.   The pool is shaped like  an  oval  and  in the
center of this side chamber.  To the east is the center of the forge.

This  passage appears  to  have been worked over for some reason.  The
walls are flat, as are the ceilings and the floors.  In the floor here
there is a large set of stairs leading down into a chamber beneath the
passage.  To the south  a  set of mine tracks can be seen in the large
tunnel, while to the north the smooth passage continues.

Perhaps this passage has something to do with the stone-cutters. It is
hard to understand the love these folk have for working with stone and
metal, or anything to do with the ground in general.   It is something
in their blood you suppose.   The smooth passage leads north or to the
south where a staircase can be seen decending to a deeper level.

You do not imagine that this part of the mine is being used for mining

The passage turns sharply to the south and east.  The precision of the
stone-work here is amazing.   The floor,  ceiling,  and walls have all
been smoothed perfectly flat.  Circular stone archways  have  replaced
the wooden beams here.  It is obvious that this part of the mine is no
longer being mined anymore.

Smooth Passage~
Here and there young stone-cutters  are  working out the final details
of this passage.  However,  they are young by human standards only.  A
dwarf after reaching maturity can figure at least spending fifty years
of  working  in  the  mines before they can even apply to being a true
stone-cutter.   In addition to simply hacking away at the stone, it is
important  to  play  very  close attention to detail while working the
stone.  The passage runs east and west here.

Smooth Passage~
The passage takes  a  turn  here.  This part of the mine must have run
dry  a  very  long time ago to have been worked over like this.  Sharp
corners  and  perfectly  smooth  walls best describe this room.  Along
the base of the floor there is a stone footing. Graceful archways have
now replaced the wooden beams here.   Aspiring stone-cutters are given
the  task  of  working  these walls as part of their training.  To the
south the passage appears to come to a dead end.

End of the Smooth Passage~
The smooth passage comes to an end here.  The western side of the dead
end is still rough.   It will most likely be expanded when a new group
of  apprientance  stone-cutters  graduate.  You figure it will take at
least another twenty years for  that to happen so you best turn around
and explore something else in the mean time.

friend.  You  wonder  if  any  of  these smiths would be interested in

levitate up and down upon command through a magical lever.   The floor
of the thing is made of wood.   A good dozen ropes run up and down and
connecting this device with the ceiling.  Unless you are a clever sort
of fellow, this device is just too complex for you to understand.   If
you can not figure out how it works you better turn around.

Bend in a Narrow Passage~
The narrow passage bends  to  the  east and south here.  To get around
the bend you have to really squeeze between the rocks.  This obviously
is not the work of the dwarves.  Probably a natural crack that was too
small for the bulky dwarves to pass through and they never bothered to
repair it.  Perhaps once their problems have been solved they will fix
this crack?  To the east you can just barely to make out a chamber.

Abandoned Chamber~
You think maybe this chamber is the cellar of a guild above.   Perhaps
even the cellars  to  the  rumor  dwarven vault where they store their
mountains of gold and mithril blades?   Either way that narrow passage
was not made by the dwarves, it looked too natural.   You suspect that
you are not wanted here by the reaction  of  the guardian.  The narrow
passage leads back to the west while an heavy stone trapdoor is set in
the ceiling above.

are doing their best to brace the room up with wooden beams.  H owever
their best might not be enough.  A natural passage leads up and out of
this cave, while you can go just about any other direction from here.

This chamber was abandoned long ago by the dwarves.  Since it has been

are several hunched shapes moving to and fro about this chamber.  Here
along the wall you notice that there are several stress cracks.  Maybe
this place is more dangerous that it looks.

Orc Guard Post~
Here at a narrow point in the tunnel a pair of orcs are posted to keep
out any intruders or keep in any goblin that is trying to avoid doing
their work.   The tunnel is supported in a few places by wooden beams,
but far too many of the beams  do not look like they are going to last
much longer.   There is something unsettling about exploring these orc
made tunnels.

Entering a Crude Orc Tunnel~
This is definately the work of orcs or there allies.   The ugly things
are just crawling the tunnels.  After clearing the guards stationed at
this post, you take notice of the rotting timbers used to brace up the
earth and stone. Maybe exploring these tunnels is not such a good idea
after all?

Outside a Crude Tunnel~
To the west there is a crude tunnel leading down into the earth.  From
the look of entrance, it is not a very sophisticated operation.  After
getting a good whiff of the air coming from the tunnels you guess that
it is being made a crew of goblins or orcs.  They must be digging this
tunnel for a reason, maybe you should explore it?

levitate up and down upon command through a magical lever.   The floor
of the thing is made of wood.   A good dozen ropes run up and down and
connecting this device with the ceiling.  Unless you are a clever sort
of fellow, this device is just too complex for you to understand.   If

This natural cavern is moderate in size, and at first appears natural.
However,  the walls,  ceiling,  and floor,  however strange it may be,
appear to have been eaten away.   Above a passage leads away from this

However,  the walls,  ceiling,  and floor,  however strange it may be,
appear to have been eaten away.  In this far corner of the carvern, it
looks like the walls could still be holding something valuable. To the
west the cavern continues.

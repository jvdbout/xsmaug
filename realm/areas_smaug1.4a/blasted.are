you have the feeling that its bright eyes are watching your every move.
With a feeling of trepidation you look back at it and notice it appear
to move.  Was it the ground trembling, or is this statue magically able
to come to life?

This man before you looks as if he has traveled the world in but a few
short days.  His armor is rusted, his clothing tattered, his weapons

battle cunning.  Where exactly he is from is unknown, but he has come to
these lands for aid, and will perhaps find it.

Victoria Dragonslayer~
A young woman, dressed in ornate battle armor walks here.

This young woman has the look of wisdom in her scarlet eyes.  Her brown
hair falls down to the middle of her back, and her lips are small and
well formed.  If not for her cloven foot and the vestigal wings coming
from her back, Victoria could easily pass as a mortal rather than the
demon-spawn that she is.

A man bedecked in ornate armor stands here ready to slay all who oppose him.

Before you stands the supreme dragonslayer.  Headri man-handled the 
dragons of yore long before the coming of the clan by the name.  His
arms are as thick as tree trunks and his chest as wide as 2 barrels,
his intelligence and wit are uncanny and he is known for outsmarting
many a dragon.  His power stems not from within though, but from an
unidentifed source which may never be known.

you to death, or the creatures kill you.  You have lost track of

Selic's Work Room~
A drafting table stands at one side of this open air work area.  Next
to the table are several axes and saws, as well as a few hammers, chisels
and other building paraphenalia.  A large sheaf of parchment contains
the complete layout of the land to arise from nothing.  A mystic portal
is to the east and leads to the blasted lands which have been completed.
To the south another portal leads to Darkhaven, while to the north is a
small log cabin that has been carefully put together.  Oddly enough it
never seems to rain or be cold here, and the small pool to the side looks
rather inviting.  A large stack of lumber and mystic building blocks are
stacked along the far side of the pool.  Next to the drafting area is a 
small refreshment stand with various drinks and appetizers.

The Entrance to the Blasted Lands~
You stand here at the edge of the blasted lands.  You check your gear and
can only hope you have what will carry you through essentially unscathed.
The parched white bones of people and creatures unknown to you litter the
sands ahead..and you know the journey will be long and arduous.  You
realize once you set foot within you might die, but the possibility of
treasure and magic, which you have heard tales of, is a mighty tempting
lure.  It is even said that an ancient city lays at the other side.

This area is designed for levels 25+...however it is best advised
to read descriptions thoroughly and to look for hidden help.
Doing so will improve your odds of success and also help you enjoy

plaque~
From the annals of Minsher of Darkhaven:  "I have finally escaped the
horrid desert!  After long months of being trapped I am finally free.
For those of you who wish to brave this land...  I leave you this 
advice.  Always look carefully about as there are many things hidden
which will help you in your endeavours.  Also do not venture past here
unless you are sure you can last a long time in the desert.  The ways
to escape are few and hidden, but with perseverance can be found.  I
wish you the best of luck in your journeys, and also that the deities
smile upon you."  
This was inscribed on this plaque before you soon after Minsher fell
to his death in an inn in Darkhaven.  No one knows how or why he fell,
only that he had tried to trade several cursed items before his untimely
death.  Beware Adventurers!!!  The land beyond is fraught with peril.

You have wandered through these shifting dunes of sand for so long
that your skin is cracking and sand has covered you from head to foot.
You can only hope that the visions you see are real and not desert
mirages as all before have been.  You plod over the next dune in the
hope that you will be finally free of this cursed land..unfortunately
nothing save more dunes await you.

You have come across yet more sand dunes.  You think back to the time
when you enjoyed the cool breeze of Darkhaven and the shade of trees.
Looking about you realize how good you had it then, and how foolish
this journey has become.  If only you had known the dangers that 
awaited or the terrible size of this desert.  However, the lure of
treasure and glory, or perhaps just your desire to explore, has led 
you to this miserable sand dune in the middle of nowhere.

The sand around you swirls as the wind picks up.  Unfortunately it is
a rather hot wind and brings no comfort to you.  Off to the east
you can see a sandstorm and hope you can outrace it.  Fortunately all 
other directions appear much safer.  At least you can attempt to 
fight the creatures of this forsaken land, but who in all the 
realms can battle the very elements?

You come over yet another sand dune and see before you a paradise.
You have finally escaped the blasted desert and stumble upon an
oasis.  As you look around thanking your god for your life, you 
see the air slowly shimmer and realize it was naught but a mirage.
What you thought was a palm tree is in reality a pile of bones,
while the water is completely non-existent.  You get up slowly
and wearily plod on, hoping that soon you will find escape from this
land.

race or profession once were.  However, a glimmer of metal shines

You have finally staggered into something out of the ordinary, a half
buried tomb in the desert sands.  As you walk around slowly you see
that sand has covered the floor to a depth of several inches.  The 
walls are sand-scoured and apparently anything which was on them has
been destroyed by time.  The hall continues to the east, but what is

This hallway depicts all the victories of Bangesd the IV.  From 
the lack of vivid descriptions, you believe that most of his
victories were in his mind rather than in reality.  He thought much
of himself but did little to impress the masses.  If he had not been
pharaoh, you doubt this tomb would have been made.  The panting
you had heard earlier is obvious now.  Some creature transferred a 
poor dog here and it is dying of thirst.  You chuckle as you realize
how worried you were.

an era bygone, or a deity who now receives worship in another form.  A
statue is against the north wall, while several oddly shaped objects 
are hung off the walls.

statue~
The statue before you is old and neglected, yet still seems to

examination you can make out the features of a once beautiful 
woman and a small inscription at the base.
 
"He who wishes to partake in the peace of Bast need only look to the
heart to find help."

hallway that leads deep within the earth.  Could this be the tomb of
some powerful pharaoh or king.  Or perhaps the lair of some powerful
wizard with command over the very earth.  There is but one way to tell,
and that is to venture within, but do you have the guts and skill that

are odd inscriptions which have been completely erased by the passage
of time and the blast of sand.  None are legible or recognizable to

dread medusa; a band of valiant men who tried to defend Ofcol from
the hoards of Orcus and perishing in the attempt.  Many other heroes
are also depicted, yet the one that is most recent is not in keeping
with the style of the other frescoes.  Apparently Selic beat you here,
exploring and attempted to depict his slaying of Shimmergloom.  You
laugh at his brazen ego and at his rather poor artistry.  If he fought
like he painted, he would never have made it out of the academy.  You
decide that you will definitely need to laugh at him when next you 
see him.

The theme of this hall's paintings disgusts you with its depravity.  You
see depicted the spawning of the Dread Lord Seth's children by his demon
concubine.  Jade, Natasha, and Maximillian all sit at his feet like the
spiteful children that they are.  A group of demons are in one painting,
they are evil incarnate, and you name them one by one; the Devil, Lucifer,
Satan, even, the Pit Fiend of Shadowport.  These are the true evils that
you must one day defeat.  As you watch, you realize that this very hall
is growing.  Obviously, more demons enter these Realms of Despair daily.
If you ever escape this hellish tomb, and the desert around it, perhaps
then you will be brave enough to battle these other fiends.

empire did not last long.  Each statue seems to be of exquisite and
personalized detail.  As you look at each, you can only hope that

of the statues look to be valuable in their own right.  If you were

in.  As you move in to look closer at this bastion of fell power,
you hear a slight grating sound as the bier opens up to reveal
a man in tattered robes.  The man brandishes a staff blazing with 
dark power, and stands revealed before you as a lich.  Lich!  The
word echoes through your mind, as it conjures forth images of this
most powerful of the living dead.  Before you can  do anything else,
the lich utters a word.  Suddenly, this being is shrouded in fire
and lightning.  With another word he is encased in godly protection
and more than ready to commit to battle with you.  As the battle
begins, you have a premonition that soon, very soon indeed, you may
encounter this creature's fell deity.

The Halls of Ramases~
You have entered Pharaoh Ramases VII hall of history.  This long
corridor depicts his life in its entirety.  From his birth to Hadensi
XI, to his first victory in battle at the age of twelve, you come to
see that Ramases was not only a powerful warrior, but a master of the
magical and summoning arts.  He bound many fell creatures to his will
and slew many others with his spells of power.  Without a doubt, you
think he was one of the most powerful mortals to walk these realms.
Perhaps, if you are lucky, he does not still exist in one form or
another.  For some reason though, be it intuition or clairvoyance,
you doubt this and know you must now search this tomb for clues on
how you may either defeat him in combat, or escape from this tomb
in which he is trapped.

The Foreboding Hall~
The hallway to the west was a depiction of the life of Ramases; this one
continues the opposite theme.  All the troubles which plagued these lands
after his death are artfully depicted.  The coming of the curse and how it 
affected all save this very tomb, is rendered in stunning elegance on the
east wall.  Other paintings adorn the west wall with beautiful renditions
of unknown people, and monsters battling within these very halls.  To your
dismay, you notice that few of the human defenders won their fights.  Then
gasping in stark terror, you see a painting of yourself and a creature
battling, yet you have never seen this creature before?  Something
mysterious is here and you will definitely not stay longer than is
necessary.

This corridor branches to the south and has a door on its northern face.
There is a slight glow from the south and a faint smell which you can't
quite place.  To the west the hall continues in darkness.  A small pool
of blood is before the doorway and you can hear a faint scratching from
within.  Perhaps an exit, but more likely some undead fiend which you

center of the room.  Although the cover rendition is realistic of his
actual looks, you are not the least surprised when the lid crashes to
the ground and a fit and healthy Ramases steps out.  You wonder in idle 
curiosity if he will be your friend or foe, but as his spells of
protection encircle him you decide it best not to wait till he is 
done preparing before attempting to kill him.  As you make your attack
plan, he steps back to finish his casting.

The Ruins of Mistaniq~
Staggering over the sand, you have come upon a city that is partially
uncovered.  Perhaps within this remnant of an empire you can find 
valuable treasure or ancient artifacts; perhaps, if you are luckier
than most, even a way out of this dreaded land of sand.  How people
can stand to live in this forsaken place is beyond you, but that is
their choice as far as you are concerned.

a nice comfortable place to relax in a pool or tub of water and not
have that abrasive scratching from the sand.  To the east a shop that
dealt in fabric of some sort lies, while to the west is a wine shop.
Off to the south you can make out a fountain now, in between the two
pyramids.

nothing to explore.  The buildings around are filled with sand - those
that are still standing and uncovered that is.  You have the distinct

by these sands is eroded and decayed and looks dangerous to all. 
Walking along the edge, you come to the realization that there are small
eggs buried under the sand.  Looking carefully, you see that they have
leathery shells and are quite pliable.  Then seconds later a shell cracks
and a horrific creature attacks you.

of value here and you wonder what this establishment was like in its
finer hours.  Sadly, you realize that nothing in here compares to the

well.  You can see wine casks stacked against one wall, while a tap
maker is resting on a large bench.  In addition to the tools of the 
wine-maker there are several bottles of old wine set on a rack.  
Examining the dates you are unsure as to their age.  It seems that
this city used a different scale of time reckoning.  Well with luck 
they might fetch a nice price on the market and if not....well there
are other ways to get rid of the bottle.  You smile at that particular
thought and head for the exit.

before it rights itself.  The hall before you slopes down at a slight
angle and leads forward into darkest black.  The walls seem to quiver
as you pass, as if in anticipation of your flowing blood being spilt.
You must soon turn back or all might be lost.

rites by which Set created his servitors.

Of course, you may just end up 6 feet beneath the ground if you choose
poorly in the times ahead.  Already you can hear a gong in the distance
summoning more servitors to do battle with you.  Unless you can discover

decipher Set somehow convinced Thoth to curse the Djinn to serve Set.
What was intended by Thoth as a punishment to the Djinn has now been
turned to Set's advantage and you can only hope that Thoth will one
day rectify the evil he inadvertently committed.

center of the darkness which has rooted itself within this pyramid.
The walls and floor appear uneasy at your passing and ripple and flow
about you.  As you walk forward one wall begins to spout blood.  The
magical rites needed to bring this about are unknown to you, yet you
have a gut instinct they required the shedding of many innocent's 
precious blood.

The Choice of Deaths~
The hall you have entered has exits in the four cardinal directions.  Each
corridor going away is shrouded in darkness, and you have a feeling that
great power and magic awaits you no matter which path you choose.  Your
judgement is upon you, and you suspect that it will not be fair.  Now is
the time to prepare as from here on it seems your powers might be unstable.

The Hall of Anhur~
The hall before you is washed in blood and held up by violence.  The lord of
war and magic, Anhur, keeps a small throne here for when he is in attendance
of this area.  Each wall has several violently graphic descriptions of war at
its most violent.  Renditions of towns and cities being razed to the ground
while women are raped and all else slaughtered are the norm here.  You feel
an anger growing within you, and wish nothing more than to do battle with
the deity who tries to make out war as something to be glorified.

and garbage rise up to your waist and the putrid smell makes you sick.
As you lean over to relieve yourself, you see the slime part and a long
tentacle come racing towards your throat.  You can't even get sick in

which depict the history of Set.  From his beginnings in a far distant land,
to his betrayal and killing of Osiris, his brother.  To make you even less
inclined to proceed you realize that his brother was the supreme being of
the time.  Perhaps Set is one not to triffle with.

Such a throne you have never before seen in your life.  Weapons of all ages
and makes adorn these walls.  Alongside the weapons are suits of armor and
other paraphernalia of war.  Yet, Anhur is not the God of War alone, he is
also the God of Magic and this is seen by the decor as well.  Vials, tubes,
books, parchment, and papers all lay neatly arranged.  The God himself is
impressive, with his leonine-like head and large muscular body.  An entire
wall is devoted to his trophies, amongst which you see the skulls of
Shimmergloom, Divine Retribution and Seth.

You have entered the hall in which Anupi makes his decision on your
afterlife.  Unfortunately, you have the feeling this is a kangaroo court,
and they aren't really interested if you're dead or not.  As the many
bailiffs approach, you realize that no indeed they do care, and they are
going to fix your little living problem right now.  With a scream you
upend a table at them, then leap amongst them swinging.  If you are
unable to flee the least you can do is have company while you die.

The lair before you is that of Ammit, the eternal dragon.  Given a
vial of immortality by Set, this dragon knows no fear as he will always
be reincarnated within a day's time.  Set himself is rumored to have two
more of these vials, yet will not use them due to the madness it inflicts
upon the drinker.  Ammit lives in squalor, and you feel yourself sickening
as he stands amongst his muck.  Perhaps now would be a good time to prove
your mettle in battle, for Ammit seems interested in a light snack.

Before you stand two tall, cast iron doors.  Bolts of magic and power
ripple across them, and you know that only with the key can you possibly
gain entry.  Of course, Lord Set himself is behind the doors so maybe not
having the key would be a good circumstance as well.  Then you can say "the
only reason I didn't slay the coward was he was hiding."  Of course, you
will always know in your heart that it was just your pure unadulterated
fear which got the best of you.

The throne before you is inhabited by a powerful looking man with the head of
a dog and the look of a killer.  His throne protects him from all but the
most powerful of attackers, while his minions are fanatical enough they
will die for him.  The walls are of an unadorned obsidian, and the floors of
bloodstone.  You look at the torches lining each wall and see that they are
set in the still-living skulls of his prisoners and servitors.  You realize
few beings in the universe are evil, but Set is without a doubt one of them.

Set's Personal Room~
You pass through the darkness of the eastern throne room wall into this.
You don't know why you thought Set would not have his own personal living
quarters, yet here you stand within them.  The bed is soft and covered in
black silk, while skeletons dangling from hooks on the walls.  What should
be a bearskin rug is instead made of sewn human flesh.  You see a large
post running across the ceiling, and upon it hang the bodies of young, dead,
women.  You shiver in your armor and hope that your stomach will not betray
you.  Your face flushes hot, betraying your feelings as you see the contents
of a drawer and begin to gasp for air.  It is at this point that the room
grows dim and a howl rises as a corpse leaps from its hook to attack you.
To make matters worse, the bed shudders and a beautiful ebon-skinned elf
woman stands revealed.  You realize the day cannot get much worse.

Entering this room, you hear the ghostly cries of previous souls and
the stench of death.  Looking about, you see all manner of torture
devices, from the thumbscrew and iron maiden, to several items you
do not recognize (nor wish to try.)  A whip hangs on the west wall,
while a leather mask and hatchet lay near the door on a chair.  Small
pieces of flesh appear to be stuck to a table and a large vat of
what can only be acid is in the southeast corner.  The demon in 
charge of this operation is rather large, but gangly.  He has a bad
limp and one of his arms is missing.  However, he still seems highly
dangerous as he leaps at you trying to sink his fangs into you.

Although his statue appears to be the soul of compassion and tender-
ness, you see paintings of his mighty battles with Set himself.  He 
is the son of Osiris and you can tell that one day he will avenge his
dead father.

they stand unwavering in their devotion to their duties.  Ra, his wife
Isis, his son Horus, Thoth the wise one, Ptah the Creator, Bennu the
Phoenix Goddess, Apis the Sacred Cow, these and several others stand
about silently judging you.  After a brief moment you see two lion-
headed creatures, almost twelve feet in height fade into view and
stand in front of you.  They look at you with compassion and a bit of
disdain, but obviously mean you no harm.  There is a door that leads 
into another room at the top of a small staircase, but the key to it
is around the creature's neck.

was rent into fourteen pieces so as to never be reborn.  As you look

when he was Lord of the Gods.

Famine will always be a problem for a feudal society and few can

could rule the world.  Unfortunately, Thoth is a little more absent-minded
than the deities would like and has forgotten to write down more than he
has written.  Known as lord of invention, wisdom, as well as knowledge,
Thoth has few enemies other than vampires due to his affiliation with
Ra the Sun God.  Yet despite his learning, Thoth admires cunning,
deception, and those with a fast tongue.  This makes him also
the patron of magic, and all thieving and glib-tongued folk.

are rather sure what they are and would prefer not to stick your nose
where your nose wouldn't appreciate being stuck.  Listening closely
you can hear the tremulous breathing of some gigantic creature, yet 
due to the many tunnels you cannot tell from which direction this 
sound comes.

Crude furniture and huts lay destroyed all about you.  Perhaps the
creature destroyed them when it found this place?  As you wander 
through the debris you get the distinct impression that whatever
came through here possessed the power of a god.  Looking about at
the total carnage you see blackened spots on the ground which on
closer look is the impression left from a body that was burnt so
badly by hellish fire that it was etched into the granite floor.
Looking to the south you once again consider pitting your might 
against such a powerful creature.

The Cave~
This cave is too large for your liking, and with every step you take the
word..DRAGON..springs into your mind.  Without a doubt something of 
inordinately huge size makes its lair here and you can only hope
that the treasure from the battle will be worth your possible death.
As you get ready to move on you hear a rumbling sound and the ground 
before you explodes as several large elemental mounds of earth rise
up to do battle with you.  Obviously this dragon has some magic at his
control.

The Dragon's Lair~
You enter the huge lair and see the largest, yet most beautiful dragon
that you have ever laid eyes upon.  His burnished platinum scales 
glimmer softly and the look of wisdom and calm he has about him almost
makes you sit down and relax.  Looking about you see that the cave is
covered with corpses...apparently goblins and the like.  Perhaps,
no it must be, this is a good dragon, maybe even THE good dragon.
Feeling awkward and somewhat outgunned you look carefully at the great
beast.  Finally, after what seems an eternity he nods at you and 
wakes fully.  The exits to the east and west have mysteriously disappeared,
yet the way to the north looks to lead directly into the entry cavern.
Powerful dragon magic is at work here for certain.

Thoth's Hall of Mystical Portals~
You are surrounded by portals of all shapes and sizes.  Small ones 
flit about like butterflies, while larger portals slowly plod by in
what you can only term an endless symphony of motion.  You attempt
to move and find that all the normal laws of motion have been 
completely negated here.  As you wonder how you will escape this 
possible trap you are filled with the intuitive knowledge that you
must say aloud the destination you wish to go to.  With proper 
planning this room could make your forays into adventure easier.

The Blasted Lands~
The stories you could tell of your journeys are probably never to be
told again.  You have wandered through this hellish desert for more
time than you care to remember.  As you cross the 4,000th dune (or was
it the 40,000th...you cannot seem to remember anymore) you see a huge
swirling sandstorm before you.  As you look upon it you remember
a vague tavern tale of such a storm.  Looking again you realize the 
sandstorm has faces that form upon it.  Without a doubt this must
be the cursed storm of Ramases VII.

memory~
Racking your brain for answers to the storm, you dredge up all the myths
and rumours which started you on this quest.  You remember one such tale
which spoke of the great pharoah Ramases VII and how in his death a curse
was laid on his city.  For his actions in bringing about the ruin of the
city of Mistaniq, he was cursed that upon his death his own city be 
covered by the sands of time.  Within hours of his death (or so the legend
goes) his city was covered in a swirling sandstorm and the only thing
left uncovered was his tomb.  Supposedly powerful magics were buried with
him, but also powerful guardians.  The only hope to recover such would
be powerful heroes (i.e. you should be 40th level+ to proceed into the
swirling sandstorm.)

The Selfless Sacrifice~
As you begin your attack on the man you see his skin crack and fall
off of his scaly hide in chunks.  Standing before your drawn weapons
is a beast from the netherpits of hell.  His great axe gleams in the
light and with a backhanded swing he almost decapitates you.  You 
realize the test is quite a bit harder than you had first thought.
Hopefully, you will survive this one.

When you hit the ground, you land on hundreds of rusted and poisoned
spikes.  As your blood pools around you and the poison courses through
your veins, you wonder how the afterlife will be.

The Log Cabin~
This small cabin is where Selic goes to escape the hustle and bustle.
On the north wall, you see a small fireplace which is blazing nicely.
To the south lies Selic's work room.  While against the east wall is
a small table with a divine smelling meal upon it.  To the west you
see the private sleeping room with a bed.  In front of the fireplace
is a comfortable couch for two.  The east wall has a window set in it
and you can hear the sounds of waves in the distance.  A small chest
is at the foot of the bed.  A small room adjoining the bed room is the
bed room for Chandra.  A small door to the north leads to the beach which
surrounds the cabin.

This comfortable bed is made for two and is covered in fur blankets.
The pillows are fluffy and the bed looks to be well made.
~
E
fireplace~
This small fireplace is made of brick.  A cozy fire blazes within it, 
while atop it is a shelf made of polished mahogany.  On the shelf are
a few tributes and trophies which the Windrunner's have aquired over
their years of adventuring.
~
E
windows~
Looking out the window you see the cabin sits on a small hill over-
looking the beach and ocean.  Waves lap against the shore and sea-
gulls fly lazily by.  You sigh wistfully to yourself and think the
view spectacular.  Perhaps sometime you will go down to the beach 
and lay out in the sun or play in the water.
~
E
chest~
This small chest is hand made of fine woods.  Opening it you find an
array of Cyranis's and Selic's clothing and personal items.
~
E
east e sunrise~
Looking out this window you see the sun just creeping up over the 
horizon.  A scattering array of pinks and orange fill the otherwise
dark sky.  When the Windrunner's are up early enough they stand here
with a warm drink in hand and there other in their spouse's hand and
think warm thoughts and talk softly of things only those in love
might understand.
~
E
w west sunset~
You look out the west window and see a sunrise as beautiful as the 
dawn yet holding the promise of yet another day to come.  Selic stands
here at nights with his arm wrapped around his wife and stares out
with her into the sky.  You sense a feeling of warmth and love that 
will always be present.

chandra chandra's~
This small room is not overly large for the daughter of an immortal
and a powerful druidess.  The walls are painted in bright colors, 
all of which make the room comfortable, as well as cozy.  A small 
unicorn lies at the foot of the soft bed and looks up when you enter.
Unless you are Chandra, this perky little creature will likely not enjoy
your company.
~
E
unicorn~
This small unicorn is possibly the most innocent and beautiful animal
you have ever seen.  Its white fur glistens as it rolls about on the
bed, and its bright ivory horn shines with a holy light whenever its
friend and mistress, Chandra, plays with it.

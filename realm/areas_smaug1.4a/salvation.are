1 Salvation~
The citizens of Salvation welcomes you to our fare city.  We were 
established on the belief in the greater good for all beings.  We 
wish only for you to see the good that has come to us as a result 
of our servitude.
 
The city of Salvation serves as a waystation for all travelers entering
from the desert to the east or the mountain country which lies on the 
opposite side of this community to the east.  We began as a caravan, 
and, like so many of you, traveled through the desert.  The cool 
mountain air and the moisture of the area was our salvation.  Thus 
the name.  We believed we had gone as far on our migration as we 
were meant and began this settlement to aid others as they trekked. 
 
This area is intended for levels 15-30.  Take heed, brethren...
and remember your warning.
 
Thank you to my family for helping this become a dream come true.
Have fun, and Long Live the Realms!
 
         Xenedra Seccunda-WyldWynd of RoD, A.K.A. Alex, Divinicus of Storm
         June, in the Year of Our Lord, 1096

faerie~
a mischievous faerie~
A mischievous faerie chases butterflies through the glen.
~
This lithe creature is shorter than the average man, but taller than you
would have expected, not the faerie of the faerie tales.  Her wings are
gossamer strands woven together in nature's wonderful ways.  Each vein 
visible to the naked eye, because of the enlarged version of it.  The 
limbs of the wings stretch out behind her delicately supporting the
fibrous lengths.  Her eyes are grey.  The pupils stand out, giving
this creature an ominous look to her behind shading lashes.

Waif-like features are accentuated by high cheek bones.  The frock worn
by this creature looks as if it had been woven from the fine fibers of a
spiders web.  The almond shaped eyes of this creature look more like that
of a hawk than anything else.

quick wits and nimble pose, he possesses certain qualities of leadership
which are valued by the other elite.  He works as hard as the others,

to meet the expectations he has of himself.

sloth mold moldy blob deniva~
Deniva~
A &gmoldy&P blob of fur, called a &bSloth&P swings with her Master.
~
So whats a sloth?  Sloths are a very rare species, which one
breed is native to the Storm area.  They resemble monkeys, and
have a perpetual humanistic grin on their face.  A layer of mold
usually encrusts these mammals because they sit in one place for
a long time - This mold is also used for camoflouge.  Camoflouge
has been Sloth's saving factor which has kept them alive through
many a hunting season.  Some sloths were rumored to be as large
as elephants during the ice age.  This certain Sloth is very tame,
and grins at you lamely.  It is very loyal to its Master, Lara whom
it adores so much.  A nametag with the inscription "Deniva, Code 2"
is around the toe of this animal.  Sloths are known to be especially
fierce, especially if there is potential danger to its master.

Her flaxen hair rushes down her back in a sharp pony-tail.  You see
by the defined muscles which peek around her armor that this woman
is very toned.  Her quick eyes dart around the area taking in every
bit of her surroundings.  Her pointed ears listen intently for any
sound that might be out of the ordinary.  Anastasia is otherwise not
the most beautiful woman you have seen, but she is handsome in her own
way.

A drum beats a haunting requiem here.
~
This drum mysteriously beats on its own.  It is made of a bloody cow
hide stretched over a hollowed smoldering tree trunk.  Beat, beat, 
beat, pound, pound, pound.  It hold you in its trance.  When one is
in the presence of evil, a feeling of filth covers even those who are
not so pious.  Stay your distance and beware.  The fight with evil
shall bring ever more evil into your presence before righteousness
prevails!

Bazimar, the undertoad, is swaying in the current.

It looks something like a frog, but somehow it is actually uglier.
The bulging eyes protrude painfully.  The florescent yellow bumps
sticking up from its blue back look peculiarly like warts.  The
webbed feet it uses to propel it through the water have tears and
holes in them.  He has a nasty temperament.

As chief constable, he is burdened with the overall safety and
welfare of the community, as well as the wishes and commands of
the despot of these lands.  His light disposition is clouded by
his heaviness of heart.  Perhaps in happier days he was not so
brooding.  He continues to be nonetheless stoic, however.  His
girth is that of a strong man, but he covers it with loose
fitting armour.  His fiery red hair runs stiffly down his
back from under his helm.  His eyes give a window to the 
kindness, as well as the hard edge which he possesses.

god had written through him, breaking them.  He then ordered the golden
idol destroyed.  This idol's surface shines almost blood red in the blaze
surrounding him.  The light dances and flickers in its holed eyes.

but she was of royal decent prior to the marriage, so she learned some
lessons by watching her family.  She is of a good heart and nature, but
is not above doing what's necessary to save country or king from possible
downfall.  Her beguiling smile will surely win over any man.  Mischief
lurks behind her blue eyes.  She seems very pleased with herself.

Autumn, the bathhouse maiden, sits with her feet propped up on her desk.
~
Autumn's build is full.  She has high cheek bones, long auburn hair,
and blue-green eyes with a twinkle of mischief in them.  There's 
something seductive about her smile; the way she watches you as
you move around the room; the way she looks up at you through 
shading lashes.  She is not particular about her company in the
sense that she is not prejudiced by race, class... or gender.  
She is capable of speaking on a wide scale of topics, but knows
when speaking has reached its end point.  Consider her carefully.
There is more to her than meets the eye.

deputy member~
a member of Salvation's finest~
A member of Salvation's finest is trying to find undead.
~
This young ranger is brave and believes himself to be strong.  The
only problem with him is that his courage might be mistaken for
stupidity.  He is not the smartest Salvationer around, but he'd
fight to save your life without even thinking.

Robed Apprentice~
a robed apprentice~
An apprentice of magic is here clothed in dark robes
~
There is nothing spectacular about this follower of Maklu.  His features
are plain and unextraordinary.  He looks as all the rest of his fellow
apprentices do... young eager, intent on doing what is good and right,
humble.

magus Maklu~
Magus of Maklu~
A man sits here uttering some incantation.
~
From another plane, Maklu came to find a new home...  Just as the
undead had.  Together they represent the opposing powers of good
and evil in this land.  The start white hair of this Magus of Maklu
runs down his back and is held back in a poney-tail.  His body
bulky and obviously strong.  His eyes glow an odd electric blue.

unicorn mystical creature~
a unicorn~
A mystical creature restlessly snorts as you approach.
~
You are looking upon purity.  The awe that overcomes you, bring you
to your knees, and tears come to your eyes.  Never before have you
looked upon or been so near something so very purely good.  This
majestic and magical creature fears man.  It does not fear man because
it fears pain.  It fears man because it would give so much to man and
man has only used its goodness for selfish purposes in the past.  There
is no happiness for one so greatly lost as this poor creature.

The High Magus Maklu is here expecting your arrival.

The air that sizzles around this presence is stiff and fetid.  It is
not a bad thing, oddly enough, however.  There is something inately
good about this being.  Maklu is goodness, come to seek a new home
in this unchartered land.  Given his size and stance, be warned now
against choosing him as a foe.

Entrance to the Safe Haven for the Destitute~
The people here have hit rock bottom.  You must be among them in the poor
management of your money.  Perhaps you squandered it away on ale and fine
blackberry wine.  This is not necessarily a place you would like to spend
a lot of time.  If you should decide to continue through the gates to the
north, be on your guard.  Those who have wandered over these stained and
worn cobblestones before you may seem harmless, but they have experienced
the uglier side of life.  They are hardened by the many trials of their
struggling existence.

Front of the Safe Haven for the Destitute~
As you look around, you see that the benches that line this walled perimeter
are occupied by a diverse population.  Some are bandaged, while others look
merely disheveled.  The energy at the forefront of this shelter is filled
with tension and hostility.  The rumble of conversation is hushed to a low
whisper as you make your way further east to a counter set against the outer
wall.  You could always elect to return to the road to the south.

places with paint and chipping with each gust of wind.  It is bare and

walls.

Greeting Area of the Safe Haven for the Destitute~
You stand in an open-air reception area before a long counter.  Behind it a
receptionist sits in clutter and disorganization.  Papers are strewn across
the desk, and there are stacks of papers on the floor, as well as on some
shelves behind her.  There is a shelf off to the side with many volumes of
haphazardly shelved books.  Papers stick out of some of them, while others
have been placed upside down, sideways, and backwards on the shelves.  To
the west is the front of this odd building.  To the north is a door leading
to its interior.

There are several different types of books lined side by side on this

The smell of urine assaults you as you enter this stairwell.  It seems to be
uncomfortably unsafe in this narrow adjunct.  The only light source is the
flickering candles on the wall in the corners of the landing.  Shadows dance
along the two toned wall of muted cornflower-blue and sand-beige.  The rough,
splintering, wooden railing spans the length of this stairwell.  It curves up
and around the landing to the second flight of stairs.  On the wall abutting
the landing, there is a mural attempting to depict a brighter, happier day.  As
you look down the stairs, you are bombarded by the comparable brightness of the
greeting area.

The Second Flight of a Rickety Stairwell~
The darkness of this space pushes you to get out as soon as possible.
The smells bring on a feeling of nausea and add to the feeling of panic
within you.  The sounds of the multitudes from above and below are mixed
with the scuffling sound of someone dragging a foot.  The shadows in the
corners seem to be occupied.  Looking up allows you to see the railing
of an impassible third flight of stairs.  The railing is broken and 
leaning precariously over head.  The stairs are broken in many spots
and only go half way up to a boarded area where the landing would have
been. To the west is a dimly lit hallway.  Looking down only allows 
you a glimpse of a blood smeared mural.

This dorm is not too dissimilar to a barracks, except that there are only
sixteen bunks.  These must be for the privileged few.  This room is also
like a hospital recreation room.  These castoffs from a battle raged and
done have various wounds and oozing bandages.  Those able to sit up are
sitting on logs and playing games with multi-colored stones or colorful
cards in t-formations.  On the south wall, burlap sack mats have been
stacked. There is also an exit on that wall that will return you to the

abdomens and heads lay here on some of the burlap sack mats.  The air here

Here women and children attempt to rest away their ailments and torments.
Their faces are black with grime, and their eyes are pink with sleepless
nights and worry from their travels.  Some of the children toss and turn
in their sleep, crying out occasionally from sickness or a nightmare.
Every noise echoes in this hollow area.  The high ceilings and the bare
furnishings lend to the emptiness that must be felt by the recuperating
occupants.  To the north is a door with a sign on it, and to the east are
a few more women and children taking a rest from the chaos of the outside

You are standing in front of the entrance to a huge building.  An arrival
from either the east or the west would leave you exhausted, both mentally
and physically.  Here, at this place of refuge, you are not alone.  After
all that walking, you hope you have found a place to rest your weary body
and soul.  The road to the east continues towards the wastelands.  If you
were to go west you would go towards the church in that direction and the
city beyond that.  North leads you to a safe haven of sorts.

To the east lies days of traveling through a desolate wasteland.  There are
some lost oases there which kept wayfarers' minds at peace.  They reminded
them of simple beauties and far off lands which they had visited or which
they dreamt of visiting.  To the west you can see through the fence which
surrounds the properties ahead.  You glimpse the abject populace that may
very well be the castoffs of the community ahead.  It is a shelter of sorts

Though there is no one on this road presently, this is where traffic
seemed to be heavier at some point in time.  The plains to the north
and south are dry, brittle grasses.  As the wind blows around you, 
gimcrack blades rustle, creating a lonely song in the emptiness that
abounds.  A look to the northwest, however, reveals a different vista
of misty mountains and thick woodlands.  With the sun blaring down on
you, the coolness of that panorama seems quite inviting.
There is a plaque upon a rock here.

The citizens of Salvation welcomes you to our fare city.  We were 
established on the belief in the greater good for all beings.  We 
wish only for you to see the good that has come to us as a result 
of our servitude.
 
The city of Salvation serves as a waystation for all travelers entering
from the desert to the east or the mountain country which lies on the 
opposite side of this community to the east.  We began as a caravan, 
and, like so many of you, traveled through the desert.  The cool 
mountain air and the moisture of the area was our salvation.  Thus 
the name.  We believed we had gone as far on our migration as we 
were meant and began this settlement to aid others as they trekked. 
 
This area is intended for levels 15-30.  Take heed, brethren...
and remember your warning.
 
Thank you to my family for helping this become a dream come true.
Have fun, and Long Live the Realms!

Walking and walking... will you ever have a moment of rest?  Perhaps ahead is

One of its tongs leads up a dirt road towards a farmhouse.  As you look east,
you can see a church and a huge building with people mingling outside it.
As you approach the church, the winds die down a little, adding a sense of
serenity and peace to your varied emotions.  A conflicting feeling of unrest

The faint scent of an earthly incense tickles your nostrils as you enter this

by tall candlesticks, four on each side of the open doors leading south.  The

wind here does not seem caustic, but the whipping of the grass, grains, and
trees surrounding the farmhouse indicate a much different pattern within as

Kitchen of the Farmhouse~
OH!  What is that smell?!  The inhabitants of this house left in a
hurry.  On the south wall, a stove still has a pot filled with rancid
stew.  The ladle is mostly submerged in the muck.  The table is still
set with plates, the food rotting where it was left.  The floor  is
cluttered with debris.  There are cabinets on the west wall next to
the door and also on the north wall.  There is another door to the
east which leads to the barnyard.

Foyer of the Farmhouse~
The only light here is the light filtering in from the adjoining room and the
doorway to the south.  On either side of the railings of the stairwell leading
up are pedestals.  Each pedestal is crested by a vase.  The floor is carpeted
with an ornate rug which stretches from one side of this large entrance to
the other.  The areas behind the pedestals are encased in darkness.  The
floor trembles with each consecutive beat of the drum emitting from the
west.  There is a room to the west and a door to the east.

Sitting Room of the Farmhouse~
During the day, light streams in from the windows covering the south and west
walls.  The floor is of polished oak, with a deep, dark finish.  Small throw
rugs have been placed before the two tattered, thickly stuffed chairs facing
the fireplace on the north wall.  A rot iron pipe rack that had been placed
beside one of the chairs is now turned on its side.  The ashes of previous
fires are dancing in the breeze that flows down the open flue and through the
shattered windows.  You can see a hectic view out the windows when the hole
filled curtains flutter in the wind.  The remaining panes of glass rattle

In the Barnyard of the Farmhouse~
A fresh breeze rustles your hair as you make your way across the barn
yard.  There is a pin off to the north that apparently contained some
of the animals that used to be here.  To the east is an old barn, and
to the west is the farm house.  Down the hill you can see the tops of
grains swaying in the wind.  Beyond that the steeple of the church 
and a road leading along the edge of the plains below can be seen.

The smell which pervades here is not wholly unpleasant.  There is the

animals that were once housed here, and, unfortunately, the smell of
the pin permeates the near pleasant aroma.  The stalls that are on the
north and south wall are standing wide open, except for one.  There is

On the Road to Salvation Just Inside the East Gate~
A decision to move forward must have been made.  If you've come from the
southeast, you've stepped into a place that still smells of the undead
that ravaged this area not so long ago.  You feel an uneasiness come over
you as all your senses come alive.  What's making you feel so insecure?
Try to shrug it off.  You'll need your energies later, no matter which
direction you head.  Southeast will lead you out the town gates.  If

On a Path to the Dock~
The road continues to be a sloppy mess. The prints you saw in the
mud further back can be seen here, as well.  Huge padded feet with
talons seem to have stopped here.  The ground is torn up.  The mud
is greatly disturbed.  Some prints go south and northwest, while two
sets appear to have gone north into the boat makers stall that stands
there.  The rumbling heard from the east mingles with the trickling
of the water off the mountain's side into the pond to the west.

On a Little Bitty Dock~
When the sun has risen above the mounds of the desert far to the east,
and just before it dashes beyond the mountains to the west, it glistens
off the water at the center of this mucky pond.  The rays send sparks of
light dancing across the waters still surface.  The light flits just as
fireflies on a warm summer night, dancing to the music of the brush that
rustles on the pathway to the east which leads to this dock.  From here
you can enter the water to the north, west, and south.

The sun lights certain parts of the room and leaves others in shadows;
one side of the dull, brown dresser on the east wall, next to the door,
and not the other.  It brightens one half of the patch work quilt on the
bed directly in front of you, and not the other; the bottom of the door,
but not the top.  The wooden floor that you cross is covered in part by
a huge, thick, oval rope rug.  The bed covers part of the rug.  There
is a wardrobe in the corner opposite the door, reminiscent of a story of
which you once heard.

As you come to the climax of these stairs, you see a small pedestal
with a bowl of dead flowers sitting in it.  The bowl is placed on top
of an aged, lace doily.  The banister that runs on either side of the
staircase does not look very sturdy.  Some of the posts of the banister
are missing, and it is disconnected from the wall next to the doorway to
the west.  Remind yourself not to lean on it as you make your way along

The Guest Room of a Farmhouse~
This room is small and scantly furnished.  The bed is simple and made of
unpolished wood.  It has short, plainly chiseled pine posts holding it
off the ground, and there is a patch work quilt with holes in it covering
the lumpy hay mattress.  There is a plain wooden four drawer dresser placed
against the east wall.  There is a water basin sitting on it, still having
nasty, stale water stagnating in it.  The north wall has a small stained-
glass window in it.  This seems to be the only form of decoration that
this room has other than a piece of polished metal that acts as a mirror
propped against the wall above the dresser.  The window splashes hues of
blue, purple, and red across the small trunk beneath it, the rug thrown
across the top of the trunk, and the splintering boards of the floor.
Your only exit is to the west.

they meant "flop house".  The floor is covered with a thick, red, soiled
carpet.  At the doorway leading to the street to the north, the area is
matted and stained.  The mud and dirt have not been cleared from there
for quite a while.  The candelabra hanging from the high ceiling is lit,
but the lighting here is poor.  Shadows drape over a large griffin carved
in stone situated to the side of the stairwell leading up.  A painting
hangs beside a small door on the east wall.  There is a large framed

masked with a fiery orange beard and mustache.  He is balding in the

You stand in a hallway between two rooms.  There is a rug running

The width of the rug is only one third of a meter.  The wall that 
you face is clearly made of a grainy wood.  It is painted a color 
that is a cross between a light yellow and beige.  A painting is
hanging by one of its corners on the wall.  There is an embossed
plaque at its base.  A pedestal lays on its side.  The vase of
flowers that once crested it has spilt.  The contents of the vase,
including rotting flowers, splashed across the bare wood of the
floor then over onto a strip of the rug.  There is a stairway

Stable Road~
A gentle breeze rustles through the tops of the weeds in the small
field to the east.  Ahead of you, continuing to the southeast, is
the building which houses the stables.  It peeks above the road's
small peaks and ditches.  The smell of hay and horses now comes to
you.  To the northwest is the road that leads through town.

The smells of horses hang in the air.  The moist hay that has been spread
on the dirt has a particular smell all to itself.  There are eight stalls
in all.  Four on both the east and west walls.  Blankets have been draped
over the walls separating each stall.  Bridles and bits hang from hooks on
the posts which support the walls.  There are saddles stacked on atop the
other on the south wall.

Britannia Street~
You have just stepped off of the main road running through this once
quaint little town.  This road leads to a small residential area.  It
is singular in its existence, as there are no other houses within the
city's gates other than these.  The road is bordered by large oaks.
The pleasant mist which hovers here floats in and out of the branches
which canopy this stretch of street.  A rumble can be heard
from the northwest.

On the Road to Salvation~
With the weight of the world on your shoulders and the sweat and dirt of days
of travel on your face, you have come upon a place of holiness.  It seems that
the wind here is quieter.  A sense of peace surrounds you.  You can hear more
clearly the chirping of the birds, the twirping of the crickets, and the ever
so gentle rustling of the grass in the plains to the north; the tranquil and
soothing sounds of nature.  To the south are the ever-open double doors of a
church. The road continues to the east and west.

The oaks continue to loom on either side of you and are joined by pines

rounded and sometimes circular patterns.  The hollow roar is becoming

for someone to enter.  As you entered, the grey fabric covering the walls
from ceiling to floor falls and hides the entrance through which you came.
Not only is the floor vibrating, but so seems the air around you.  The

This room would be very plain were it not for that noise!  There is a
table set along the length of the south wall.  The finale of a
progression of beakers and tubes is a cauldron and the booming emitted
from it.  The only decoration is a red flag displaying the symbol of
the apothecary.  The floor is merely packed dirt, muddied at the edges

It seems that the further a venturer proceeds along this trek, the more

the town that used to be, away from the more estimable areas and houses,
and their perfunctory stance, is a simple hovel.  It is complete from a
technical point of view, but aesthetically it is devoid of any type of
exterior ornamentation.  You can enter this house to the north or return

The city of Salvation serves as a waystation for all travelers entering
from mountain country or the desert which lies on the opposite side of 
this community to the east.  We began as a caravan, and, like so many 
of you, traveled through the desert.  The cool mountain air and the 
moisture of the area was our salvation.  Thus the name.  We believed 
we had gone as far on our migration as we were meant and began this 
settlement to aid others as they trekked. 
 
This area is intended for levels 15-30.  Take heed, brethren...
and remember your warning.
 
Thank you to my family for helping this become a dream come true.
Have fun, and Long Live the Realms!

of higher powers, whether they be the world around us or an actual deity.

School of Many Philosophies~
This is not only a place for basic education.  It also provides a scholastic
approach to the different avenues available for spiritual following.  It is
understood that spirituality gives one a sense of hope in the outcome of life's
struggles through a unique nexus with the transcending power or powers of the
world.  The Spiritual Custodians recognized that no one dogma would fit all
people and decided to provide the information that would allow the people to
follow whatever their hearts desired.  The way continues to the west, or
can exit to the east.

In the Room of Nature~
This is an unorganized philosophy.  In its original form it was 
a philosophy followed by the uninfluenced masses.  They believed 
the ultimate truths in life were found in our surroundings; those 
things which affected their way of life directly; those things with 
which they dealt on a day to day basis.  Mother Nature is the provider 
of all things necessary to life.  The Wind, Rain, Sun, and Moon, among
others, are deities unto themselves.  This philosophy is a return to
aesthetics and the appreciation of beauty, simplicity, and the 
inspiration Nature has to give when we respect Her.

In the Room of the World Soul~
One small group of founding Salvationers were not unlike the Brits and the
Celts in that they recognized a caste system.  This system was the catalyst
for social control.  They were dissimilar, yet amalgamated by their varying
philosophical beliefs into "one immanent, all inclusive, all sanctifying,
World Soul".  When they arrived to this side of the storm, they adopted the
deity Alex and named it their World Soul.

idol destroyed.  This idol's surface shines almost blood red in the blaze
surrounding him.  The light dances and flickers in its holed eyes.

In the Room of the Islands of the Rising Sun~
A certain group of islanders far to the east of the realms believe that
their islands alone were a creation of the gods.  The poem on the wall
recounts the origin of their national philosophy.  Their main deities
include the Sun-goddess, Moon-god, the Star-god, the Mist-god, and
their emperor.  Their first emperor was said to be a direct
descendant of the Sun-goddess.

In the Room of the Prince and the Pauper~
While walking his countryside one bright morning, a prince came across
four things which would change his entire outlook on the world around
him.  He saw a feeble aging woman, an abominably debilitated man, a
corpse, and a self-disciplined religious man unaffected by the troubles
around him.  The prince repudiated his title, whatever claims he might
have had, and all of his possessions.  He went off in search of freedom
from transgression.  He gathered groups around him and then sent them
out to spread the word that suffering widdles away at your soul.  To
recognize it, to accept it, to allow it, is to dehumanize yourself and
make yourself miserable.

In the Room of Origin and Order~
One origin of philosophy for the people of Salvation is based on true
loyalty, or Piety, to the immortals, to family, and to friends in that
order.  One should treat the orders of their hierarchy as they wished
to be treated.  This philosophy helped bring together the people of
several far removed realms.  An incorporation of this philosophy with
others was the foundation for order for the people of this humble 
town.

A Disgusting Mess~
King Ine's queen, Ethelburga, had attempted to persuade her husband to
denounce earthly, material things.  After failure upon failure, she
devised a plan to win him to respectability.  The king and queen went
out for a weekend of frivolity, as was their custom.  The queen sent
a servant to do her bidding about the house while they were absent.
When they returned from their weekend, the king found that the manor
had been liberated of its previous luxury.  Excrement of cattle had
been spread liberally about the place along with heaps of dirt and
grime.  The most ostentatious of these atrocities was a then recently
furrowed cow being put to rest in the king and queen's bed.

Being Queen of the West-Saxons and queen to her husband are both burdens,
but she was of royal decent prior to the marriage, so she learned some
lessons by watching her family.  She is of a good heart and nature, but
is not above doing what's necessary to save country or king from possible
downfall.  Her beguiling smile will surely win over any man.  Mischief
lurks behind her blue eyes.

In the Room of Kent~
King Ethelbert of Kent was wrought by superstitions of the sorcery and
darkness that abound.  In the year of his lord 597 AD, he met with
St. Augustine regarding the war waged between the Britons, Celts, and
attacking German tribes.  He agreed to an audience with Augustine and
and his group, but he required that the meeting be held outdoors.  He
feared that he would be susceptible to their magical arts and that
they might deceive and master him were they to meet him in a house.
Here King Ethelbert roams out to the garden to the north and back 
again, nervously awaiting their arrival.

Camelot nearing the year of their Lord, 500 AD.  The legends that
surround this king of the British are many and varied.  One says he
laid down 960 men by himself in the twelfth battle against the Saxons.
Though there might have been men more nobler in birth, he was twelve
times the bellwether in the war and victor of the battles.

In the Room of Iceni~
Prasutagus, the King of Iceni, made the Roman emperor co-heir to his throne
in an attempt to deliver his land and family from assault.  After he had been
killed by the unaffected Romans, his wife, Boadicea, and his daughters were
brutally wronged.  The tribes of Iceni were enslaved, but then rose from their
servitude to challenge their captors.  Boadicea took this opportunity handed
her to lead the Brits with vengeance against the Romans.  They took the hated
Roman settlement of Camulodunum, as depicted in the painting on the wall.
Another Roman division of 10,000 decided to surmount the tribes and won.
Unfortunately, 80,000 Brits met their end in the forthcoming battles.
Upon seeing the futility of the situation, Boadicea poisoned herself
in the year of her lord 61 AD.

As is true of most taverns of this epoch, this one is dark and musky.  One

smoke into the room occasionally.  The tables sport bits of discarded scraps
of nutriment.  Through the cracks of the wooden floor, you can see scampering
creatures running about underneath it.  Bar stools line the long counter on
the west wall.  There are a three paintings decorating the dark walls, and

not occupied are at the top so that ripples, looking as waves, cascade
from ceiling to floor.  A door, that seems to almost glow in this dimly

Autumn's build is small.  She has a pretty waist line, high cheek bones,
dark hair, and light colored eyes with a twinkle of mischief in them.
There's something seductive about her smile; the way she watches you as
you move around the room; the way she looks up at you through shading
lashes.  She is not particular about her company in the sense that she
is not prejudiced by race, class, or gender.  She is capable of speaking
on a wide scale of topics, but knows when speaking has reached its end
point.  Consider her carefully.  There is more to her than meets the eye.

The Bathing Room~
You have stepped down into a bright room.  Though there are not

of glass, allowing sun or moonlight to peer down and cast strips
of light through the steam clouds that obscure parts of this room.
There are several bubbling pools about the floor, all set into the
dark boards so that you would have to step down into them to bathe.
Beside each pool is a wooden bench.  On each bench, a pole with a 
couple hooks at its top is attached, acting as a rack on which to
hang your armour.  Nothing has been placed upon the walls.  There

The tall sunflowers that grow in this part of the field droop in one

dance as the wind whips them around and about.  The ground has turned
black.  A lone sunflower lay on the ground.  It actually still looks
healthy.  The small patch of ground surrounding it remains moist and
fertile.  The drumming continues to set you on guard and is emitted

I wage not any feud with Death
 For changes wrought on form and face;
 No lower life that earth's embrace
May breed with him can fright my faith.
 
Eternal process moving on,
 From state to state the spirit walks;
 And these are but the shattered stalks,
Or ruined chrysalis of one.
 
Nor blame I Death, because he bare
 The use of virtue out of earth;
 I know transplanted human worth
Will bloom to profit, otherwhere.
 
For this alone on Death I wreak
 The wrath that garners in my heart;
 He put our lives so far apart
We cannot hear each other speak.

Before my pen has gleaned my teeming brain,
Before high-piled books, in charact'ry,
Hold like rich garners the full-ripened grain;
When I behold, upon the night's starred face,
Huge cloudy symbols of high romance,
And think that I may never live to trace
Their shadows, with the magic hand of chance;
And when I feel, fair creature of an hour!
That I shall never look upon thee more,
Never have relish in the faerie power
of unreflecting love;- then on the shore
Of the wide world I stand alone, and think,
Till Love and Fame to nothingness do sink.

My spirit is too weak- mortality
Weighs heavily on me like unwilling sleep,
And each imagined pinnacle and steep
Of godlike hardship, tells me I must die
Like a sick Eagle looking at the sky.
Yet 'tis a gentle luxury to weep
That I have not the cloudy winds to keep,
Fresh for the opening of the morning's eye.
Such dim-conceived glories of the brain
Bring round the heart an undescribable feud;
So do these wonders a most dizzy pain,
That mingles Grecian grandeur with the rude
Wasting of old Time- with a billowy main-

So, dearest, now thy brows are cold,

 And what I see I leave unsaid,
 Nor speak it, knowing Death has made

My mind to me a kingdom is,
 Such present joys therein I find
That it excels all other bliss
 That earth affords or grows by kind;
 
I see how plenty surfeits oft,
 And hasty climbers soon do fall;
I see that those which are aloft
 Mishap doth threaten most of all;
Content to live, this is my stay;
 I seek no more than may suffice;
I press to bear no haughty sway;
 Look, what I lack my mind supplies:
Lo, thus I triumph like a king,
Content with that my mind doth bring.

 I grudge not at another's pain;
No worldly waves my mind can toss;
 My state at one doth still remain:
I fear no foe, I fawn no friend;
I loathe not life, nor dread my end.

Fear death?  To feel the fog in my throat,
  The mist in my face,
When the snows begin, and the blasts denote
  I am nearing the place,
The power of the night, the press of the storm,
  The post of the foe;
Where he stands, the Arch Fear in a visible form,
  Yet the strong man must go:
For the journey is done and the summit attained,
  And the barriers fall,
Though battle's to fight ere the guerdon begained,
  The reward of it all.
I was ever a fighter, so- one fight more,
  The best and the last!
I would hate that death bandaged my eyes, and forbore,
  And bade me creep past....

And Immortality.

For his civility.
 
We passed the school where children played
At wrestling in a ring;

And all the men and women merely players;

Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel,
Unwillingly to school.  And then the lover
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress' eyebrow.  Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
Jealous to honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon's mouth.  And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lin'd,
With eyes severe, and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part....

Where he stood perplexed and still...
  But only a host of phantom listeners
That dwelt in the lone house then
  Stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight
To that voice from the world of men:
  Stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,
That goes down to the empty hall,
  Harkening in an air stirred and shaken
By the lonely Traveler's call.
And he felt in his heart their strangeness,
  Their stillness answering his cry,
While his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,

For he suddenly smote on the door, even

  But that I kept my word," he said.

If poisonous minerals, and if that tree
Whose fruit threw death on else immortal us,
If lecherous goats, if serpents envious
Cannot be damned, Alas! why should I be?
Why should intent or reason, born in me,
Make sins, else equal, in me more heinous?
And mercy being easy, and glorious
To God, in His stern wrath why threatens he?

Lost in the Catacombs of Wisdom~
You are moving through what might seem to be an inescapable horror.
The walls here are covered with an interesting mix of alternating 
four inch yellow and brown stripes.  Parts of this corridor are
decorated, while some of it lacks any type of refinement.  The
area is lit by the perpetually burning oil lamps placed just out
of reach at the top of the walls.  Except by moving, there is no
way out.  Looking is learning the path to enlightenment.

painting~
The Muse, disgusted at an age and clime
  Barren of every glorious theme,
In distant lands now waits a better time,
  Producing subjects worthy fame:
 
In happy climes where from the genial sun
  And virgin earth such scenes ensue,
The force of art by nature seems outdone,
  And fancied beauties by the true...

Death, be not proud, though some have called thee
Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so;
For those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow
Die not, poor Death; nor yet canst thou kill me.
From rest and sleep, which but thy pictures be,
Much pleasure; then from thee much more must flow;
And soonest our best men with thee do go-
Rest of their bones and souls' delivery!
Thou'rt slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men,
And dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell;
And poppy or charms can make us sleep as well
And better than thy stroke. Why swell'st thou then?
One short sleep past, we wake eternally,
And Death shall be no more: Death, thou shalt die.

mirror~
When in the mirror of a permanent tear
Over the iris of your mother's eye
I beheld the dark tremor of your face, austere
With space of death, spun too benign for youth,
Icicle of the past to pierce her living sigh-
I saw you wish the last kiss of mother's mouth,
Who took the salted waters rather in the suck
Of seas, sighing yourself to fill and drench
With water the plum-rich glory of your breast
Where beat the heart escaping from war's luck.

red flame fire~
Red paths that wander through the gray, and cells
Of strangeness, rutted moldings in the brain,
Untempered fevers heated by old kills,
By the pampered word, by the pat printed rune,
Unbalanced coil under glaucous blooms of thought,
A turning mind, unmitigated thinking that
Feeds human hunger and eats us alive
While cringing to the death, expecting love,-
Such make the self we are.  And do you make it?
And practice on us?  For we cannot take it.

No longer mourn for me when I am dead,
When you shall hear the surly sullen bell,
Give warning to the world that I am fled
From this vile world, with vilest worms to dwell;
Nay, if you read this line, remember not
The hand that writ it; for I love you so
That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgotten
If thinking on me then should make you woe.

Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.  Humpty Dumpty had a great fall, and all
the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't put poor Humpty
Dumpty back together again.  Don't be as foolish as the Humpty-Man.
Look before you tread, brethren.

Before I sigh my last gasp, let me breathe...
...Therefore I'll give no more, but I'll undo
The world by dying; because Love dies too.
Then all your beauties will be no more worth
Than gold in mines, where none doth draw it forth;
And all your graces no more use shall have,
Than a sun-dial in a grave:
Though, Love, taught'st me, by making me
Love her, who doth neglect both me and thee,
To invent and practice this one way to annihilate all three.

This is just a thought... just a query... weren't you paying attention?
Did you miss the warning in there?  Did you NOT read the sign that was

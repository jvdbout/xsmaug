dimensional shambler~
Dimensional shambler~
A dimensional shambler shuffles through here, phasing from plane to plane.
~
Shuffling towards you is the gigantic, blasphemous form of a thing
not wholly ape and not wholly insect. Its hide hung loosely upon its
frame, and its rugose, dead-eyed rudiment of a head swayed drunkenly
from side to side. Its forepaws were extended, with talons spread 
wide, and its whole body was taught with murderous malignity
despite its utter lack of facial description.

A malkavian vampire~
A Malkavian vampire stands before you, giggling and jabbering to himself.
~
A dishevelled, shifty eyed vampire stands before you, his mood shifting
from moment to moment. One second he's suspicious and paranoid, eyes
scanning the room and its occupants suspiciously. The next moment, he's
giggling and dancing through the planes. The stench of madness wafts
strongly from this one.

Abattoir~
The grinning, maniacal being known as Abattoir is here.
~
A simple looking man stands before you; average in every way except
for the air of malignancy and the powerful psionic aura emanating 
from him. As you watch, flickers of dark power rise from him, like
the flickering flames of a torch. As you watch, he levitates himself
off the floor, and grins maniacally.

The GlassWalker~
An enthralled GlassWalker, cloaked in shadows, stands guard before you.
~
As you squint to see the guard in the dim light, you are suddenly
horrified to see that it is something you'd hoped never to cross paths
with: A werewolf! Standing over 7 feet tall and covered with thick grey
fur, this lupine bears many battle scars. Saliva drips off canines made
for crunching bone. However, he appears glassy eyed, and you get the
feeling he is under some sort of enchantment...

say Cursed place it is, but not always was it so. Once it was
' run by the clergy and clerics of the Realms. The citizens of
' the realms who suffered from mental afflictions were brought
' here, and their needs were tended to. Until a few years ago.
' Several years back, we received a new _inmate_. 
' I 'member that gods forsaken day all too well; he came here,
' smirking that smirk, and walking like he was king o' the hill.
' Since he got here, things went from bad to worse. At first,
' it was little things. The normally placid inmates became
' violently active. Ochk reverted to vile habits of old.
' Whispers of dark magic and evil workings abounded.
' It was whispered he was a being of dark and powerful magic...
' Who knows.

wished for the physical world, after having mastered the conscious.

mpecho Day of the Bull, 1st of the Month of the Ancient Darkness.
mpecho They call me mad. Attempt to lock me up in this gods forsaken pit.
mpecho Yet, how do you explain that madness has not dulled your senses,
mpecho but heightened them?
mpecho My experiments must continue.
mpecho Day of the Dragon, 3rd of the Month of the Ancient Darkness.
mpecho My mind, aching from the quick succession of monstrous conceptions
mpecho it has been forced to confront during my imprisonment...
mpecho (the writing at this point gets blurred)
mpecho ... worked upon this startling new material in a cycle of doubt and
mpecho acceptance which repeated most of the steps experienced in facing
mpecho the earlier wonders.
mpecho Mad or sane, metamophosed or merely relieved, I am now privy to
mpecho dizzying new vistas of cosmic and superhuman knowledge.
mpecho The Day of the Dragon, 14th of the Month of the Ancient Darkness
mpecho ... to shake off the maddening and wearying limitations of time
mpecho and space and natural law... to be linked with the vast OUTSIDE
mpecho ... to come close to the nighted and abysmal secrets of the
mpecho infinite and the ultimate... surely such a thing was worth the
mpecho risk of one's life... soul.. and, yes... sanity.

mpecho Day of the Sun, 27th, the Month of the Dragon.

mpecho My visions... I do not as of yet wholly grasp them...
mpecho yet their contours touch deep violstrings of ancestral emotion.
mpecho I could tell that I was at the gateway of a region half-bewitched
mpecho through the piling up of unbroken time-accumulations; a region
mpecho where old, strange things have had a chance to grow and linger
mpecho because they have never been stirred up. 
mpecho ...My vision.... and my experiments... continue.

mpecho Day of the Rat, 13th, the Month of the Water Serpent.

mpecho Never was a sane man more dangerously close to the arcana of
mpecho basic entity - never was an organic brain nearer to utter
mpecho annihilation in the chaos that transcends form and force
mpecho and symmetry. I have learned many secrets...
mpecho I have guessed the secrets of the gods, and the black truth 
mpecho veiled by the immemorial allegory of Tao. The legend of
mpecho Giy, Father of Serpents, remained figurative no longer.
mpecho It was shocking to have the foulest nightmares of secret 
mpecho myth cleared up in concrete terms whose stark, morbid
mpecho hatefulness exceeded the boldest hints of ancient and
mpecho medieval mystics.
mpecho Day of the Jester, 18th, the Month of the Moon Festival
mpecho They come for me now... I hear them... in the walls...
mpecho ..the floors.. even crawling under my skin... they
mpecho come for my immortal soul... yet I know not what I fear
mpecho most... the fact that they are here... or the fact 
mpecho .
mpecho that.... I.... welcome.... them.....

Walking the Planes~
On this plane of existence, time has no meaning. You walk between
the different planes, travelling between them, through them.
You travel the plane of dreams. For years your dreams had known 
only such twisted reflections of every day things as the commonest
slumbers know, but now there returned a flicker of something stranger
and wilder. Exits lead in random directions, a reflection of the
chaotic cadence and vaguely awesome imminence of the plane.

Walking the Planes~
You stand before a portal of ancient and immense power. It draws
you and twists your perception; at one moment, you see across the 
realms, at another moment, you see the nether realms of the ninth 
plane. Images from half dreams and your subconscious flash before

and take a look around. You find yourself in a musty hallway,

Heart of Darkness~
The room is nothing like you expected. After all your travels, you
expected to find the pinnacle of atrociousness and malignancy here.
Instead, you find a simple padded cell. The cell is simple in and of
itself, with a tiny cot, wash basin, and window high up on the wall.
The cell appears commonplace, almost boring, until you look out the
window. The cosmos flashes by, hundreds of images per minute. And
then you notice the occupant.

sight of a forbidden island. You think you spy a large building of some
sort in that direction, but cant be sure from this distance. You suddenly

were incarcerated, and that this asylum was built upon a rural and
merciless island.

Entrance to Abbot Hill~
Suddenly, you are upon it. Before you looms a structure that seems
almost unnatural in the twilight.  A dark, foreboding building with
gothic spires reaching for the sky, it sends a shiver down your spine
and you take an involuntary step backwards.  The building, once a
beautiful monument to the architecture of its time, now stands as a
monument to the Great Ravager, Time. Even though decrepit, you
feel that the building will stand witness to the passing of centuries.
Before you are the wrought iron gates that serve as entrance to this
home of the insane, while above the gates hangs a time worn sign.
Almost as odd and disconcerting as the asylum, however, is the guard
before it, shrouded in shadows.

Descent into the Depths~
The cave is filled with an ethereal, otherworldly darkness that not
only affects your vision but afflicts your soul. The darkness is crushing,
oppressive, malignant. An odd green mist wafts through the room lazily,
almost as if it were capable of independent thought. Various corpses litter
the room, in various stages of decay. A soft chittering fills the room
as the parasites swarm over their meat, consumed by the feast of entrails.
Oddly enough however, the layout of the room gives you the impression
that the door you just passed through wasn't meant to keep people out,
but to keep someone, or something, in...

This room seems to be like the rest of the maze, except for one thing.
Grown in among the bushes, you notice what seems to be an old childs doll.

by an old crumbling wall of approximately twelve feet. Peering through the
bars in the gate you can faintly make out the outline of a small
building of some sort, a small house or large shack. Climbing a decrepit

Graveyard~
The first thing you notice upon entering the graveyard is the fact that
the air here is more humid, and colder. It clings to your skin, sending
involuntary chills down your spine while suffocating you at the same time.
A light fog pervades the air here, not allowing you to see the whole
graveyard completely. The stone wall follows the pathway running east and
south.  The graves in this area are simple ones, yet, oddly, they are
filled in loosely, as if whoever did it was in a hurry, or expecting
them to rise up again.  The earth is soft, and you see different types
of tiny animals squirming through it. The grass that grows in patches
here is tough and brown, matching the landscape.  The only signs of
there ever having been life here is various types of dead flowers resting
under the grave markers, which stand ever vigilant over their cares.
Squinting through the fog, you notice various mausoleums and the like
off in the distance. A path leads east and south.

off the path, and you imagine that it must have once been used to carry

that the shack is made from the same stone as the wall. The inside of the

gravedigging. Various sized shovels, hammers, and spades hang from wall
pegs, while various sized nails sit in buckets absently placed on the floor.

moonlit sky. The walls are a pale white, contrasting starkly with the
surroundings and sky above you.  A large, heavy door seals the mausoleum
to the outside world, and is shanked by two child-like angels captured in
stone.  Above the door, you notice a carving.

Mausoleum~
As the mausoleum door closes behind you with a deep, resounding thud,
you take a moment to quickly scan the interior of the mausoleum. As your
eyes adjust to the semi-darkness, you survey the interior.
The walls are plain stone, with carvings and writings spaced at even 
intervals, praising several deities and basically trying to appease the
gods in the hope of easing the passage of the deceased into the heavens.
Several iron fonts are also imbedded into the walls, for the purpose of
placing torches into them to illuminate the area. 
A tomb is the focus of the mausoleum, and sits in the center of the room.

A thick layer of dust covers the floor and the tomb, which is placed near the
center of the room. Several paintings can be seen on the ceiling, some 
depicting some form of rebirth after death, others depicting an ascension to
a higher plane of existence. There is a sconce on the wall, and an incense
burner hangs to the right of the doorway.

garnishings don't make the mausoleum seem beautiful, but a tawdry, loud
display of a persons wealth. Various large gems, rubies, and diamonds are
embedded deep within the stone and seem to be protected by enchantment.
The mausoleum is also done in several types of stones, successfully
achieving the image of a loud, mismatched building. You shake your head
as you consider that whoever built this had more of a trophy in mind than
a final resting place.
Someone has scrawled a message onto the mausoleum wall.

Mausoleum~
The first thing you notice about the inside of the mausoleum is that it is
as gaudy as the outside. Apparently, whoever was buried here did not want to
part with his or her wealth, even after death. Various chests, weapon racks,
and other storage units of baubles of wealth are strewn throughout the room;
unfortunately for you, they were emptied out ages ago by grave robbers.

The stone wall blocks passage to the north, while winding its way in a

considering the complete absence of any type of breeze. The graves here are
humble ones, with simple grave markers and even simpler surroundings.

The cold, wet air sends shivers up and down your spine, and causes you to
feel claustrophobic in your clothes. The fog here is thick near your ankles,
yet thins out the higher it goes. The fog is also very still, and makes you
feel as if you've stepped out of time, into a place where time has no meaning.
You see the tops of what you assume are some sort of mausoleum to the south.

You are amazed as you travel further into the graveyard at the obvious
differences between what you assume to be the poor and the rich deceased.
Whereas the northern graves are dilapidated, mediocre looking and kept
graves, the richer graves to the south are fancier, and seemed to have
been meticulously cared for when caretakers worked the grounds.

You stand outside one of the Abattoirs mausoleums, and by the looks of 
it, one of the Abattoirs oldest. While it must have been a regal and
imposing structure in its time, age and neglect have taken their toll
here, as it seems to have throughout the Abattoir. A large, gaping hole
blocks the entrance into the mausoleum, and you're not sure whether a barrier
to entrance here is a necessarily bad thing...

The inside of this mausoleum is a reflection of the collapsing exterior.
Chunks of stone which have fallen from the roof sit on the floor, and
various kinds of fungi grow in the corners of the room, where moisture
seeps in from the outside.
Your eyes are drawn to the carrior creature perched on the casket. It
turns its eyes to you, and starts to change shape...

This part of the graveyard is a little different. Graves no longer pepper
the ground here; instead there is a clearing, with a towering oak reaching
for the sun. You assume this is where people would come to collect their
thoughts and offer condolences to the families. However, the clearing seems
to have not performed that function in a long time, and the long grass and
unkempt tree, coupled with the fog and cold air, cast a dark and foreboding
shadow upon you.

hiding all evidence of earthen floor and walls. Elegantly carved chairs
surround a large dining table. Various glass cases house works of extreme
antiquity. A large, ornate crystal chandelier hangs overhead; it must hold
dozens of candles, which shine brightly, lending an impossibly comfortable
air to the room, considering its location.

Entrance to the Garden~
You stand before the entrance way to the garden. This must have been
an important area at one time, as it seems to have been painstakingly
put together. You assume that the clergy used the garden as a therapeutic
tool, and to allow their charges the opportunity to get out of their
rooms and get some air.
There is an iron fence surrounding the garden, both to keep the residents
in and to provide an aesthetic look to the garden. Two large statues guard
the entrance. One is that of Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty. She
stands with a branch of mistletoe in hand, and is swarthed in light robes.
The other statue is a representation of Apollo, the sun god, and god of 
music and poetry. He wears a toga, and holds a small lute in one hand.
The garden is to the north.

Clerics room~
The room is simply furnished, and quite small, as you would expect
from someone who has dedicated their life to helping others in the
service of god. A tiny, well made bed sits along the wall, with a 
small night table beside it holding various candles, and a simple
desk, with various papers, quills, and the like in the corner.

Minor clerics sleeping area~
Many cots and tiny beds fill this large room, with the sparsest of
furniture to be seen. This is where the clerics, or clergy, who haven't
attained higher positions sleep and keep their sparse wordly possessions.
You assume that the larger rooms in the hallway to the south are for the
clergy with higher and more prominent positions.

Entering the church~
The church, like almost every area you have seen so far, is abandoned
and decrepit.  Dust covers the old oak pews, which stretch far off to
the north. Several of the pews have been cracked by what must have been
an unearthly force, as the pews are as solid as stone.  You raise your
eyes to the surrounding walls, and see stained glass towards the north,
along with an old altar.

The church, once a beautiful and holy place, is now infinitely old and
infinitely horrible, full of dark corners and having high ceilings where
the eye could find only cobwebs and shadows. The stones on the floor and
altar seem hideously damp, and there is an accursed smell everywhere, as
of the piled-up corpses of dead generations. The large, looming stain glass
windows stretch along the walls to the east and west.

stare shockingly, as if blinking through a lethal stupor which wards
off madness by dulling the memory of unutterable things.

You cannot make out the original image, but the new one is clear. A
battle in the heavens is depicted here, between various angels and
the gods. However, a dark shadow looms over these, and you see a pair
of ancient, leathery hands above the images, pitting them against each
other, playing the puppeteer.

Abattoir Asylum~
You have entered the holding area of the Abattoir Asylum.  The contrast
between the rest of the asylum and this area is shocking. Above; silence,
light, a semblance of peace. Here; screams and moans, darkness, and anarchy.
The lamentations and wails of the mad surrounding you is enough to drive you
to join their ranks among the insane. A cacophany of madness assaults your
senses.  You shudder as you think of what has transpired here since the
clergy have passed on, and the lunatics have taken over the asylum.

many of these benches and tables have been ripped from the ground, and
thrown across the room. The walls are splashed crimson with blood, now
caked and fading with age. Some of the splashes are just the randomness
of the mad, while some appears to be graffiti of some kind. The smell
assaults you right away, a mixture of putrid, decaying food and various

Buzzing. Incessant. Constant. Overwelming. 
You've found the source the the buzzing. This is where the food was
stored at one time. However, it has become a haven for all sorts
of insects; flying, creeping, crawling, slithering, every sort imaginable.
They fill your nostrils, ears and eyes.

Abattoir Catwalks~
You step upon the rickety catwalks, and wait a moment as the catwalk
stops swaying and your balance returns. You then take a moment to 
survey your surroundings. You find yourself suspended several dozen
feet above some sort of cavernous room. You peer over the edge to 
catch a glimpse of what lies below, and gasp in horror and disbelief.
Down below you see dozens of people stumbling and milling about, and
hear their lamentations.  You suddenly recall stories of how some of
the asylums keep their most dangerous members locked into pits such
as these, as much in the hopes that they would rid the world of each 
other as in the hopes of keeping them separate from the other inmates.
However, you never expected anything such as this. Even as you watch
in abject horror, several of the madmen circle one of the sicklier
denizens, and to your revulsion, they pounce upon him in barbaric
fashion. You find yourself turning away as they begin ripping
him apart, and close your eyes to the sounds of the feeding frenzy.

The room is filled with beakers, scrolls, and jars of rare and ancient
ingredients used in the art of spellcasting. The scent of exotic herbs
and incense fills the air, causing your senses to swirl. A large desk
dominates the room, covered with the ancient hieroglyphs. The large,
yellow skull of an ancient dragon sits upon the desk, almost as if it
were a mere paperweight.

The room is an arcane jumble of elixirs, powders, and blood. Whereas
the previous room showed some semblance of normalcy, this room shows
the true flesh pulsing beneath the thin skin. A large pentegram
is carved into the floor, and you notice in abject horror that fresh
blood runs through the pentegram constantly, fed from an unknown 
source. A huge shelf lines the wall, housing a macabre collection.
Neatly labelled and jarred are the organs of various races. Scanning
the jars in abject horror, you notice labels such as "Bugbear eyes",
"Elfen Reproductive Organs", and the like. Diagrams of various internal
workings of both creatures from this plane and the astral plane cover
the walls, and at periodic intervals you notice odd messages scrawled
into the wall. After some searching, you uncover yet another journal.

As you pass through the trapdoor, it shuts behind you with a resounding

to the fact that you cannot return that way, and focus your attention on
where you find yourself now. It seems a rather non descript room, with no
real furniture save a few empty crates. After several minutes of searching,
you are about ready to give up, when you feel a breeze coming from the north.
Upon closer examination, you find a tiny crack, which you think you can fit
through.

This is where Marion comes to conduct her business, or just to get away
from the hustle and bustle of life. The scent of jasmine and other exotic
smells assaults your senses, and you close your eyes and inhale the scent,
letting it overwhelm your senses. As you open your eyes and look around,
you notice an antique, poster size bed against the wall, with intricate
iron carvings of a bygone era. A neat, victorian type desk rests in the
corner, holding various works and the like. A thick, plush, and pink
carpet covers the floor, and you almost feel as if you're walking on a

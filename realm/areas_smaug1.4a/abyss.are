This area was mage by Honey (1995).
This area was heavily modified by Cianhydle (1998).

Beware of the Realm of the Demon, the 666 Layers of the Abyss.  While
all of the denizens of this region are deadly, this place is also the
home of several near-godlike beings, as well as a few true gods. Deep
within the darkest parts  of  this  infernal region a fallen god lies
awaiting  a foolish  mortal  to arise his anger once again.  Only the
strongest and smartest should even consider exploring this area.

The Faceless One is here...
~
This  Demon  Lord  is  a  shapeless  loathsome  creature. He 
constantly  changes shape,  but as you see  him now, he is a
nine  foot cone-like heap.  His color is a blend of blackish
greens,  foul browns and  yellows,  and sickly  transluscent
grays and ambers.  From  this mass  protrude several glaring
red eyes, pinkish ears, and sharp yellow teeth, in  addition
to several  unidentified  parts  inside the  blob  of slime.

mummy must have been a craftsman or a priest, not a king or
other royal person.

Aside from its eyes and horn-like nose, the rest of its face
could be considered human.  You should think twice about the
next time you step on an insect.

Cianhydle~
Cianhydle is plotting here...
~
This  powerful  demon  would  rather be  doing alot of other
things if it was not trapped within the Void.   Some warlock
or necromancer  bound this fiend to  damnation or one of its
own kinds  treachery doomed it to this place.  You hope that
you,  unlike this demon,  can escape this place.

~
E
one overview abyss~
Several pages of this chapter have been ripped out.
~
E
two surviving planes~
There are multiple layers of the Abyss each ruled by a demon
Lord or Prince.   The most common mode of  transportation to
another plane is gained through a portal.  Often these magic
portals are  only one direction, leaving the  poor traveller
stranded beyond the portal  and at the mercy of whatever lay
on the other side.   It should be noted that some planes are
deadly to human and humanoid life, being located near the
negative material plane.   One should be prepared to face
any number of demi-god like fiends who control legions of
foul  creatures each  able to destroy  an entire village.
~
E
three encountering demons~
Several pages of this chapter have been ripped out...
Some demonlords are know to be immune to particular kinds of
magic and  normal weapons.   Most demons are able to go into
fits of rage and use the fighting styles of warriors,  while
others rely on powerful magic or breath attacks.  One should
always use  caution when  battling  a  demon prince or lord.
~
E
four greater demon lords~
There are several known powerful demons. The assume the rank
of Lord or Prince, and the most powerful demon Lords control
sizable  areas in the Abyss.  Here is a list  of some of the
more powerful known demons.  This is not an exhaustive list,
but rather a compilation of the verfied sightings of demons.
Abraxas			Fraz-Urb'luu		  Mehrunes

A Portal Chamber~
You are standing at a portal which  leads to the Abyss.  You 
can go west and  leave this chamber.  The  portal  begins to 
swirl  as you  draw closer to it,  revealing little of  what
is on the  other side.  There are some  inscriptions  at the
top of the portal.
"Whoever  fights  monsters  should  see  to  it that  in the
process he does not become a monster.  And if  you gaze long
enough into  an Abyss,  the Abyss  will gaze back into you."

south the cavern continues.   Dark shapes move around in the
shadows of the cavern.  There is a  portal here, but it does
appear to  be working.  Your  only option  is to head south.

You are in a dark cavern.   There are exits to the east and

The shadows are become bolder,  dancing just on the edge of
the darkness.  Their  whispers are now hushed  voices.  You
are beginning to  understand  a few of  the words  they are 
speaking, but it does not make any sense at all.

also descending.  A sense of fear begins to spread over you
as you begin to understand more and more of the words being
spoke by the shadows.  You understand the word 'death'.

you do. You can feel them watching you with their malicious 
eyes, but they hold back for now.  The hushed voice are now
speaking in normal tones.   You begin to heard them calling 
your name.

lurk in the shadows are most frightening that ever. Perhaps
your light is growing weaker, because  the creatures appear 
to be closer than ever, but still  just on the  edge of the

You have entered the Kostchtchie's throne room.  You see him 
before  you sitting  upon an  immense  throne carved of ice.  
Behind him are  great collumns of ice,  supporting the great 
size of  this  room.  The  only  exit is  to the  south, out 
through the ice  door.  Maybe  you  should think about going 
that way, and going that way fast?

You are in a huge palace of carved ice. You notice instantly
that this  chamber is a  alot warmer,  and the source of the
heat.   There is a large portal in the floor that is heating
the room.  There  is  a  large  door of  ice to  the  north.
Obviously this palace is made of  a magical ice,  because it
is  not affected  by the  heat from  the  portal in  anyway.

Graz'zt's Sleeping Chamber~
You have entered the  sleeping chamber of the Demon Prince,
Graz'zt.   He is not sleeping, however.  He is awake, quite
awake, and staring at you with glowing green eyes of hatred.
The decor here is in obsidian and ivory contrasts. The only
exits  are to the  east through a  large stone door, and to
the north through an archway into a portal chamber.

The Dining Room~
You are in a dining  room within the Alabaster Palace.  The 
decor here  is quite plain, however the  obsidian table and 
chairs stands out in  stark contrast to the white walls and 
floors. There is a large stone door to the west, or you can 
go to the entry way to the east.

The Sleeping Chamber~
You have entered  a sleeping chamber.   The room has  three
obsidian beds, and there is  a fireplace in the south wall.
It  would seem quite  cozy if  there  were not  also  three
female demons staring at you from within each bed. The only
exit is to the  west.   If you survive these  flesh lusting
demonesses.

This chamber is dark,  barren of any objects, save the large
portal in  the center of the room.  The portal pulses as you 
draw closer to  it.  The  closer you get to  the portal, the 
cooler it becomes. The portal is cloudy, and does not reveal
what might  lie on  the other  side,  but you  reckon  it is 
another plane  in this nightmare realm.   There is an arched 
doorway to  the south that  leads back  into the  lair  of a 
powerful demon lord or prince.

In this corner of the dungeon,  behind Jubilex's lair, is a 
slime coated portal in the floor. The pool looks disgusting
as it is  covered with all  sorts of slime and refuse.  You
figure this is a  portal to yet another plane in the Abyss.
To the  south leads back through Jubilex's lair  and to the
slimey  dungeons.  While  this experience i n the Abyss has
opened new and  unimagined  horrors to  your mind, there is
nothing  you want more than to get out of this slime coated
dungeon and  take a  nice  relaxing  bath.

The Channels of Ice~
The winds blowing through these channels is enough to blow a
stong man away, yet you try to continue onward.  To the east 
the channel  becomes a bit narrower,  and at the far end you
can see a large pile of ice chunks.  South the channels open
up to the ice covered plains, while north leads back through
the channels.

The Channels of Ice~
A strong winds blows down in the ice channels.   The channel
gets wider to  the east.  Several large, crumbling chunks of
ice allow access to  the ice covered plains.   From here you
can see  a great  palace of ice  upon those  plains  a short
distance away.

The ice channel is a  fifteen foot deep trench cut into this 
glacier.   A strong wind blows through the channels, driving
snow into your face. This area is ungodly cold, and you just
want to get someplace warm. The channel leads north and west.

A large ice cavern  would almost be a beuatiful thing, it if
was not  for this bitter cold.  As soon  as you stepped into 
this cavern the  temperature must have dropped to well below 
zero. A stairwell made of ice leads up through a portal near
the  ceiling,  while an  opening leads  out into  a deep ice
channel to the west.

You are in a hilly area on a plane that is bitter cold. You 
wonder of the demon that rules this icy, barren realm. From
your  limited  knowledge  of demons, you know that they can 
live in places that mortals would surely parish.  From here
you can head west towards a palace of ice,  or go down into
a cold, ice covered wasteland.

ground  crunches with each  step you take.  Images  bend and
twist from the corners of your eyes.   You wonder if you are
halucinating this whole experience.

Below a Bluff~
A tall bluff stands out,  overlooking the desert you walked
through.   The sun is always standing  high in the sky, and
thus the bluff is casting no shadows.  You feel sweat break
out on your temple as  you glance up at the path to the top
of the bluff.   Gazing out at the desert, you dread walking
back through the desert.

walked through earlier, as well as a great alabaster building
in the distance.   At least there is a  breeze up here, if no
less hot. The sun beats down without mercy upon the path back
down  to  the  bottom  of  the  bluff  and  the  salt  flats.

The grasslands continue to the south,  while heading back to
a large hill overlooking the obsidian structure to the north.
The six foot tall  grass sways gently  in the wind, and looks
peaceful enough,  but do not be fooled, this is still a place
of infinite evil and unimaginable pain.

in the air is definately coming from this place.  Something
moves below,  deep  inside  the pit.   A trail leads to the
south, eventually leading up past a large rock.  You notice
now  how the rock seems  to be perched so gently that a fly
landing on it might cause it to come crashing down into the
pit.  You are almost ready to vomit from the stentch.

urge to flee and run as far, far away.

hides.  You  can  head  east,  away  from  this evil  place.

This graveyard  is barren,  with the graves appearing to be dug

west there is a gate in the fence, and beyond a great windswept
plain stretches for as  far as the eye can see.   A strong wind
blows  the dried grasses that grow along the edge of the fence.
Oddly enough, a portal hangs a few feet above the ground at the
near side of the cemetary, probably leading to another plane in
the Abyss.

Oustide a Mound~
This area is quite windy, but flat and rather featureless, 
with the exception of some scattered grasses which sway in 
the wind.   The air has a dry feel to it.  You can exit to 
the north or south.   To the south there is a burial mound
of some  sort.   The mound  has a sinister feel  about it.

A Burial Mound~
This mound is pitch black, as spheres of darkness fall upon
your lights.  From the shadows creatures attack!  Once they
have been dispatched with, you might be able to search this
area from something useful.

A Dungeon Corridor~
This narrow corridor is coated with slime.  From the cieling,
down along the walls, and on the floor, there is slime.   The
green stuff clings to your feet like mud and small globs drop
down on your clothing from above.   It would be best to hurry

The catacombs come to a dead end here. The only exit is back

dead are leaned up to rest for eternity, or so they thought.
Many of the niches are empty, even though burial shrouds and
bits of  clothing and affects  are found  within the niches.
You are overcome with a feeling to get out of here.

A Burial Niche~
The catacombs come to a dead end here. The only exit is back 
to the east.  Set into  the walls  are  niches  in which the
dead are leaned up to rest for eternity, or so they thought.
Many of the niches are empty, even though burial shrouds and
bits of  clothing and affects  are found  within the niches.
You are overcome with a feeling to get out of here.

Decending a Jungle Cliff~
Here a path connects a small ledge on the face of a cliff with
the main floor of the jungle.   To the  west the cliff decends
many hundred feet and there is no  appearant way to decend. To
the  north is the ledge,  on which you  see an  enterance to a 
cavern.  Above  the path  leads to  the tropical jungle floor.

Standing on  a  cliff,  you are  just  outside a small cave.
Peering  into the darkness is  little help, save  a strange
purple glow  near in the center of  the cavern.  East leads
into the cave,  while to the south is a  path leading up to 
the jungle.

Inside a Humid Cave~
The cave  is humid, about  the same temperature as the dense 
jungle  to  the west.  A  large  iron  grate  is set  in the 
bottom of the cavern floor.   In the near side  of the grate
are hinges and on the far side is a massive lock. Stairsteps
can be seen decending deeper into the cavern beyond the iron
grate.

A Portal Chamber~
Of course!  Yet another portal was the source of the glowing.
On the  other side of the portal  you are  barely able to see 
yet more caves, but  perhaps it is just a reflection.   Aside
from the  portal  leading to another  plane,  this  cavern is
rather  boring.   A grate  is at  the top of a stairwell that
leads to an upper level of the cave.

A Spiderweb-Infested Intersection~
Standing below this portal, dark,  twisting passages lead of
in several directions.  These tunnels are covered with thick 
spiderwebs.  From a bit deeper inside the caverns a rustling
sound can be heard.  There is a portal in the ceiling above.
Beyond the portal there looks like  the caverns continue, or
perhaps it is reflecting this chamber. Whatever the case, it
is definately a portal.  The air is still and cold.

A Spiderweb-Infested Cavern~
It is hard  to judge the size  of this cavern due to all the 
spiderwebs.   By now you have lost count of exactly how many
spiders you have  seen here.   Things move  about  overhead,
waiting for the right time to drop down an attack with their
poisonous bites!

On the Edge of a Huge Spider Web~
You are standing on the edge of a wide opening in the cavern 
floor.  Looking  down a huge  spiderweb stretches the entire
width of the room.  It looks possible  to be able  to decend
the spiderweb much like a rope or ladder.

A Small Niche~
Unlike the majority of this underground complex, this room is
void of  the large  ammounts of  spiderwebs.   A small bed of 
straw has been set in the corner of the  chamber.  It appears
something somewhat human is living, well more aptly surviving,
in this small niche.

Decending a Huge Spider Web~
Climbing the  spideweb much like a ladder, things are moving
about in almost every direction.  This must be a huge cavern,
because of the fact  there are spiderwebs everywhere.  Though 
many of  the webs are  too weak to support  your weight, this
one you are climbing and one many feet below look exceptional
sturdy.

You are standing  in the center  of Lloth's spiderweb in the 
Abyss.  Just  the though  makes you  confident  in  your own 
ability, but overcoming the Queen of Spiders will be another
thing  entirely.   The web leads  in almost  every direction
from here.  Another spiderweb that intersects this one leads
up from here.   You feel the web  below vibrate as something
moves  elsewhere  on   the  slightly  sticky  silk  surface.

Here,  hidden from sight,  is the private  residence  of the
Spider Queen.  The  walls are cavern with images of pain and
torture, along with many  spider-like  icons.  Her throne is
made  of a  pale  white stone,  adorned with many jewels and
gemstones.  Dispite  the relative  splendor  of the chamber,
this is a place of great evil and danger.

The (Nether) Void~
The matter has pulled you in  and sealed the exit above you.
Dark lifeless shapes swirl around you existing in this evil
black substance  that surrounds you.  More than before this
place is dark.  Unholy dark. A shadowy demoness stands here
to  protect this  dazzeling  altar,  the  Altar  of  Night.

The (Nether) Void~
The matter has pulled you in  and sealed the exit above you.
Dark lifeless shapes swirl around you existing in this evil
black substance  that surrounds you.   Images of nude women
and men drift into your mind performing unspeakable acts of
lust. A demon stands infront of a pagan altar which depicts
all sorts  of perverted  sexual acts,  the  Altar of  Lust.

The (Nether) Void~
The matter has pulled you in  and sealed the exit above you.
Dark lifeless shapes swirl around you existing in this evil
black substance that surrounds you. Power. Raw, uncontroled
power.  Your power.  You invision yourself as a great ruler
of a huge kingdom.   A poweful demon stands infront of this
altar to  perhaps  the  most  wicked of  all vices,  Power.

The (Nether) Void~
The matter has pulled you in  and sealed the exit above you.
Dark lifeless shapes swirl around you existing in this evil
black substance that surrounds you.  Gold, silver, gems and
jewels float through the  black matter.  You reach for them
and  they seem to  recoil from your grasp.   An eight-armed
woman stands  here infront of a huge altar  made to a pagan
vice, Greed.

The (Nether) Void~
The matter has pulled you in  and sealed the exit above you.
Dark lifeless shapes swirl around you existing in this evil
black substance  that surrounds you.  You feel  ashamed and
are compelled to stare at a gentle,  soft-skinned man  with
white feathered  wings who stands infront of an shrine made
of ivory and gold and assorted gems, the Altar of Betrayal.

((Eternal Damnation))~
Here is  the residing place of Cianhydle, Dark  Lord of Old.
A powerful being,  his true plans are not even known  by his
generals  and  marshals.  Streams of  the black  matter that
make up this  Void run into and  out of his body.   His body
continual takes  on different forms,  from man to  woman  to
beast.  You now know what lay at the heart of  the Abyss. If
you shall ever  escape and live to tell of this is doubtful.

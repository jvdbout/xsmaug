margaret black mare~
Margaret~
A large and sleek black mare is hoping to get a workout.
~
She is the image of equine beauty.  Tall and muscled, obviously in very
good condition, she looks capable of running forever, and it is clear
she is making an effort to stay still while she waits on her mistress.

the spirit avenger~
The ghost of the dread pirate Faragut is here to avenge him.

It has no distinct shape, for it is merely a spirit and not of this world,
yet it is capable of doing great harm.  As you look deeply into the misty
form, you swear you can see the malice pulsating inside.

ignis fatuus vampire man~
Ignis Fatuus~
A very old vampire looks at you appraisingly.
~
Age is a relative thing.  Most would look upon this face and see the
thousands of years it wears and call it ancient.  Ignis himself does
not see it that way.  As he is far beyond comparing himself with
humans, trolls, elves and even other vampires, he thinks of life in
other terms, and in his terms he is a child, just beginning the voyage
of life.  In your terms, however, he is likely the oldest and wisest
creature you will ever meet.

Welcome!
 
You are at the entrance to Ocean Keep, my first area.  Building it has been 
a great deal of fun, not least because of all the positive input from the 
players on the Realms of Despair, both mortal and immortal.  Naming names 
is normally not a good idea, so I won't even try, I'll just say a big thank 
you to everyone who wished me well.
 
Thanks for coming, and I hope you enjoy it.

You begin to sense the presence of a large body of water up ahead.

Overlooking Ocean Keep~
You are standing at the top of a bluff, looking down on a fair sized 
coastal village.  Activity is everywhere.  Fishermen are busily 
unloading their boats, repairing nets and trying to sell their catch, 
while traders from foreign lands are hawking exotic goods to anyone who 
looks as if they might have a little gold to spare.  A reef forms a 
natural seawall for the village, and a number of vessels are anchored 
just past it.  Boats are shuttling people and goods between the dock 
and the ships.  Roughly in the center of the village is a reinforced 
structure which serves as a safe haven when the community is threatened.  
It is also the residence of the ruling lord of this place.  You may 
proceed down the hill, or return from whence you came.

Inside the Gate~
You are standing inside a large gate that does not look as if it has been
closed for quite some time.  Though imposing with its large spikes and
heavy iron bars, the grass and weeds that have grown to cover its lower
edge speak of a settlement that has not had need of such defences lately.
South of you is a small hut, to the north is a wooded path, and you may
enter the village to the west.

Before you is the entrance to a large house, or perhaps a small castle;

iron gate and the heavily reinforced outer walls certainly give the
structure the functional qualities of a stronghold, but the prominent
flower gardens and the presence of pets and young children make it clear
that this is first and foremost someone's home.  You think you might

Well, this is a fishing village, and seafood does make up the lion's
share of the diet for the people who live here.  When you stop to

the cliffs rising out of the sea.

At this point, the seawall curves north to enclose the harbour and

ships at anchor.  One appears to be flying the king's colours, another
shows the flag of some unknown land, and yet another seems to be flying
a flag with a few white markings on a pure black background.

An opening has been created in the reef at this point to allow small

slow and dangerous for the men who performed it, many generations ago,
but an entryway had to be made, and the end result was most certainly
worth it.

The Dock~
The water of the harbour is lapping gently at the stone just a few
feet from where you are walking.  Fishing boats and the boats from
the ships at anchor farther out compete for space against the wall
of the dock.  Despite the crowding, the water really does look
very inviting.  You briefly consider taking a dip before deciding

in place, but you have little doubt that it has been at least
one century, and more likely several.

Nothing of interest here, really.  The only good thing about this 
place is that the top of the rock you are standing on is almost
above the surface, so you now only have water up to your ankles.
Looking around, you see a number of large and sharp rocks sticking 
out of the water.  It would clearly be impossible for invaders to
enter the keep by this route.  Why, anyone who tried to move too
quickly through this place would surely end up badly cut and 
bleeding to death before they could even reach the village.

crow's nest, from which the lookout keeps a steady eye on the horizon.  
Just above the crow's nest you see a banner, and as you recognize the 
insignia your blood runs cold.  Of course, you already knew you were 
on a ship of rogues, cutthroats and pirates, but up till now you didn't

You find yourself sinking rapidly to the bottom, attracting the attention

Standing on top of the prow of this large vessel affords you a very

they do not greatly impair your vision, and you are impressed by the
stark beauty before you.  The village and harbour are enclosed on three
sides by majestic black cliffs.  In the horseshoe-shaped area formed by
the cliffs you see the bulk of the manor house surrounded by smaller
homes on two sides, the market on a third, and a large wooded area on
the fourth.  Closer to you is the harbour and the rocky reef that extends
a little ways out to sea before curving back and meeting with the cliffs.

you were under the impression that all this land belonged to the lord

two or more brothers.  That would explain the sharp curve and the

as well as their swords and other weapons.  It is not considered good
manners to enter the home of your host without relinquishing your
weapons, with the exception of the dagger you use to cut your food.

The Stairwell~
The walls of the stairwell are lined with tapestries and paintings,
some new, some old.  For the most part, the tapestries show various
crests and insignia, and the paintings depict grave looking men in
armour, oftentimes with a lady at their side.

The view of the harbour really is quite spectacular.  You can see
several ships at anchor beyond the reef, many fishing vessels and
small boats inside the harbour itself, and even a good portion of
the market with the booths and stalls of vendors of all manner of
goods.  Further out, the ocean seems to blend with the sky and the
clouds sink into the water.

The Young Children's Room~
For once, the wall-hangings depict something other than clan crests
and weapons; the decorations in this room are clearly meant for the
eyes of children.  There are bright colours and swirling patterns,
and more subdued images of forest and household animals.  It seems
the younger children are kept together, for the room contains one
large bed on which lie several small sets of nightclothes.

The Master Chambers~
This is where the head of the household does the paperwork required
to run things.  There are ledgers to be kept, servants to be paid,
supplies to be bought, and numerous records to be updated every time
any sort of business transaction is conducted.  Life here is not all
fun and games, and the burden of keeping an eye on the workings of
the keep can take its toll.

Probably the most comfortable looking room in the manor, the master
bedchamber is dominated by a large canopy bed with heavy draperies
hung all around.  These are tied back right now, but from the low 
temperature in the room, you are quite sure that on cold winter 
nights they are very much needed to keep the heat in.

The Master Chambers~
One of three rooms dedicated to the manor lord and lady, this one
serves the dual purpose of crafts room and nursery.  One end of the
room holds two cribs, neither one of which seems to have been used
lately, along with chests full of baby clothes and diapers.  In the
center of the room is a large heavy table surrounded by simple wooden
chairs.  On the table you see many different handicrafts and garments
in need of repair, all in various stages of completion.

Thora's Bedroom~
Thora is the oldest of four daughters, and though she loves her
younger siblings dearly, she will go far to defend her hard won
privacy.  It took a lot to convince her father that she should
have her own room, and the great pride she takes in it is quite
obvious.  The room is spotless, and the bed is carefully made.

furs of various animals and the weapons and other equipment that
were used to bring the animals down.  Gornan prides himself on
his hunting ability, and frequently goes out in the nearby woods
with the gamekeeper.  More often than not, they bring something
back for the larder.

that has been built in the fireplace warms you well enough, and

Utilitarian is the word that comes to mind when you first enter

occupant, but serves as a temporary home for a variety of
travellers.  A fresh breeze blows in through a small window in
